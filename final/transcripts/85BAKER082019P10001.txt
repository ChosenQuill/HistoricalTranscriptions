Revᵈ & dear Father

As soon as my extreme weak-
ness permits. I take up my Pen to write you
the melancholy intelligence of the death of my
worthy Colleague Mr. Gillison, who departed this life
in the full assurance of faith August 10ᵗʰ at half 
past 11 P.M. [crossed out text] after severe pain.
I had been preparing his soul to
God. I myself have had a very severe attack of

restless, could not sleep and about midnight the
fever again attacked me & with greater force than
before and I did not get remission again till the
following Sunday Morning all which time I lay
without any rest day or night suffering much
pain as I cannot possibly describe, especially
across my back. That morning I had remission
for 24 hours took two doses of [Bark] & then ½ʰʳs
more that was next Thursday I had another
slight fever remission then I took a double dose of
Bark & till the fever took me again in that night
I had the severest attack which ever [unreadable] before morning
