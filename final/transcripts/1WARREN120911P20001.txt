Smith, the late Judge of this colony. Mr. S, received  
us with the greatest appearance of good Will,  
said that he was truly glad of our arrival & that he  
wished us equal success. After this, having written   
an Address another of our local Preachers, with   
several others Friends, we should have returned  
Back, for the Evening, had not Mrs. Waskew [unreadable] us a  
kind invitation, to lodge at her House  
where we found every thing, that was necessary to  
make us comfortable, while we were visited by Mr. M   
to make his Home our home, till we removed, yet 
I waited. Thus did the Lord provide for us —  
It was on a Tuesday Evening, that we  
landed at Sierra Leone & on the Thursday following the Society met together to hear Mr. Coles  
& little to this they appeared to be highly pleased  
and with the contents, & professed the utmost  
readiness to comply with his wishes. —  
The Society at our arrival amounted to  
110 - it is now, including those taken in our trial  
near 150 - No great proportion of them  
profess to enjoy a sense of the Divine [unreadable]  
in general as far as I can learn, conduct  
themselves with considerable prosperity —  
The Population of Sierra Leone & its environs,   
amounts I think to upw[ards of?] 4000 Persons - The Emigrants  
I have a very small proportion to the Black &   
Colored inhabitants, perhaps it did take [continued text unreadable]

accommodate 400 Persons — If Providence was fit to spare  
my Life, to continue these Prospects of success  
which we at present have, I hope in the course of a   
Year or two, to see a Chapel erected that will accommo-  
date two or three Times this Number  
which we require —  

Other House, is well situated for receiving a   
Sea Breeze, a thing of no small consequence in this   
Place, especially in the Dry Season which is now   
pretty well set in. Myself & Colleagues bear the   
Heat of this Climate much better than we  

did, both we should have hitherto enjoyed a   
good degree of Health —  

I hope you are going on comforta-  
your [business?], & that the Lord is giving you &  
your Colleagues, to see considerable Fruit of your   
labors — To hear of your success will afford me   
considerable Pleasure —  

I have to [thank?]  

Mr. Robert Pulford, Bricklayer, that resides  
at Patton, is my Uncle. If you could work any   
good on his Mind I should be heartily glad of it.   
As a Way of introducing yourself, you may [try?]  

think well of it, call on him & inform him of having   
heard from me, & that I wish to be remembered to   
him — I should have written more fully but   
I have [hitherto?] had not opportunity for so doing.   
My best respect to Ms Simpson Please to give   

my Love to your Colleagues, I also to Warrantin   

Mr. Crumleigh, I remain as ever   
Yours until I have the [pleasure?] to meet   
your affectionate Brother   
Mr. W. Yellowby by Equip &   
Adrain England   
your friend
