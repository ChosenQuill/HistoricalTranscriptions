We have also been at Salton Town where we have
a large wattled meeting house just finished. Here the
Lord is doing a great work among the Saltons and other
tribes, are converted to God, and the ministers there which
walk down their narrow lame bear the feelings of their
hearts. Glory be to God I never felt happier in my
life, I would not exchange my present station for a crown
It is my determination & that I believe of my Colleagues
also, that with divine assistance we will lay ourselves
out in every possible way to advance the cause of Christ
in this Mission: At present I find it difficult either
to understand or be understood by them, but this I hope
soon to get over. I always thought from the first
that my appointment was of God, and I am now
more than ever persuaded of it. I am fully aware that
we shall have to labor thro violent temptations and
snares, we need, and shall have an interest in your prayers
When I look at the real importance of the work in
which I am engaged, and my own unfitness for it
it makes me humble; but thank God I feel it a
consideration of no small importance, that God hath promised
to help our weakness and infirmities. I really think the
state of the Mission more promising. We intend as soon as we
to set up as many schools on foot both adult and children as we
can. There are great numbers both of children and adults
who would be glad to learn to read. We intend to put the New
whom we have been brought among a week by them, to
into 6 separate schools, here we have a Stone Chapel built
the particular of which you will have from him, & as he
is a bad matter Mr Brown man who is able to read distinctly
him we mean to place over the children as Teacher and
superintend them ourselves. We shall have one of the Natives his
where my Boy will remain, and we shall go each of us once or
twice a week, going from our own house after breakfast in the
morning to school; here shall teach all day, preach to them at
night, sleep in our hut, have family prayer with the village
in the Chapel, in the morning stay in school the day, and
return home at night, It is my intention if I can get 5 or 6,
proper persons to spend a considerable time with
them, and fit them to teach others, that the schools may not
hang entirely upon us, in which case if should we be taken sick,
they must surely fall to the ground, he intends having one boys
school in various places on this same plan in which it is
established at Bristol, & a Sunday School at free town China
which for want of help has been some time given up. Now
whilst I speak thus my dear friends at home will
blessingly supply us with Books for this purpose. I wish that kind
expectation of such interference in England could but see the
prospect, then God being my friend, that there is meant a
and then I am sure they would willingly and cheerfully you
the help we require. And I so hope that their not being eye
witnesses to these facts will not make them the less zealous

to find us apparements to carry our designs into effect
I hope dear Father you will render us this help as soon
as you possibly can, as we want to begin this work without delay
Glory be to God we feel desirous to labour while we can

as we know not how soon sickness or death may prevent
us from labouring at all. At present thank God we are both
well; the heat seems oppressive but we hope we will
soon remove this inconvenience. There are several necessa-
ries wanting in the house, most of which we can get here
and what remains Mr Brown will bring account of when
he returns home. We also are much in want of Clap
Paper, Tickets, Books of admittance &c. of which there was
none here nor has been for some time. We hope you will
help us with these things and as many Books as you can
spare us. We have purchased 10£ worth of Books of our
friend Capt Clove, who brought them here for sale and has
parted with them to us at invoice price, but these will
be swallowed up immediately without being anything like
a scanty supply, for the different adult and children's
schools we hope to set on foot. In my next you shall

have every information which I may be able to gather
I do not say any more upon my particulars as Mr
Brown will give you every information. With earnest 
hope for our interest in your prayers and a hope soon
to hear from you I remain dear Father yours

                                                Respectfully
                                                           Baker

3. There is a foundation for a new Chapel
to outside the present old one in which we now
preach in Free Town, the walls are in some places

6 feet high. I understand there is about 90£ now in
hand towards building it, and as soon as I have found
what subscriptions can be raised more and what the
thing would cost, I shall send the account to you

If we shall some time not far distant be able to
this Chapel, as it is much wanted the present
one is nealy filled at a Prayer Meeting, and I
persuaded we should (if we had a decent Chapel) have

of the most respectable inhabitants in the Colony
5 preaching. As for the Chapel the Romans are
day, they seem determined to finish it, before they
any one knows how they intend to dispose of it.
