her quiet rest & repose in the promises of the Saviour,  
yet all her desire was after him all earthly cares  
had ceased, she could resign every thing to the Lord  

& only sought for a fuller manifestation of his  
preserving love to her soul.  
Towards the eighth day, which is generally  
the highest stage of the fever & when the disorder  

took a turn either for the better or the worse, we  
found that nature was nearly exhausted with the  
repeated attacks which she had endured; yet it  
was delightful to behold her gaining fresh spiritual  

strength, her soul stayed simply on Jesus, & deriving  
consolation from his allsufficiency & willingness to save.  
She was sensible to the last, but through weakness,  
deprived of speech for a few hours before she departed,  

about ½ past 11 o’Clock on the night of the 28th Ulto.  
her soul took its eternal flight - the disembodied  
spirit is now in the presence of her Lord & Saviour  
to go out no more for ever - reaping the rich reward  

of a bountiful eternity.  
During this time Mr. G. was also very ill, the  
fever had made considerable progress & at times we  
were lift in great suspense as to its results, he had  

however materially alter’d for the better, he is at  
present free from fever, & his chief suffering is from  
the very severe loss he has sustained in the removal  
of a most affectionate wife. But behold the God.
