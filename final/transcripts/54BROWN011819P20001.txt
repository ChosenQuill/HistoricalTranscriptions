and grace with me felt very tenderly for me and may he wishful  
to know how I got through, I send you the leading thought [for I have]  
wrote the sermon.] I introduced the subject by noticing the solemnity of  
the occasion on wch the word was spoken - Mingled mercy & justice  
shewn - read 15-19 nm  

The text suggests two leading thoughts wch we shall attend to in order  
I. Dust thou art. 1st This assertion refers merely to the Body of man - history of  
it Chap II 7. 2nd It relates to all the Children of men Job VIII. 28 are brethren born  
of dust. 3rd That we are dust is our humbling consideration Jer IX 23. 4   
  
That we are animated dust formed of so many parts connected and adapted  
to the work assigned them, shews the Wisdom & power of God. Isa C XXXVII 14,14,19  
5 That we are dust is assigned as a reason for the exercise of the divine   
condescension. Isai C III 15 16 Heb II 14-18 mercy 6. That our Bodies are  

dust is a powerful reason why they shd be subservient to the interest &   
happiness of the soul. Prov VII 12. XV 12-13. Gal VI 7-8 Luke VII 16-21  

II And unto dust thou shalt return. 1st The literal sense - our frames  
shall die - be again united with our mother earth. Gen III 19 I Sam III 2,3  
2nd The decree is gone out : it is appointed Heb IX 27 Eccle II 9 III 19-20  
3 None can escape his hour. 1 Cor IV 27 28. 4 Nor are the immediate   
circumstances wch may proceed our death known to us Job XIV 23 24,25. It   
is wisely ordered that future things as well as present belong unto God alone  

we shd be overwhelmed with a prospect - as being of evils. 4th Nor  
can we tell the time of our death - in youth - middle life or  
advanced years - often suddenly. (a few scriptural examples)  
The rich fool sumptious Dives n - some have been surprised  

by it - into gems who were flushed with worldly hopes & enjoyments  
Where are they? not in the record of the living! 5th What carnage   
does death make in the different orders of society? amongst the great -  
the noble, the rich, the poor, amongst friends & kindred in the strangers  

We have to lament the death of many who were friends to civil religious  
liberty; who stood high in relation and office, whose, services produced  
extensive benefits to the nation the world: who were patrons of industry  
and domestic virtues; friend to the orphaned infant & the suffering   
poor. Of this Chancellor was her Majesty. The late Queen Charlotte

Who was united to our venerable King George in the year 1761 when  
he commenced his reign. We read 2 Kings VI 33. But there was none like  
to Ahab - Jezebel stirred up - in the case of Naboth - in introducing idolatry  
and exceeding oppression. But the late Queen never stained her conscience  
nor that of the sovereign with blood, nor did she sue for mercy & restore  

the guilty offender a penitent to society & his friends. We read Acts II 29-  
It is pretty certain many widows orphaned children will look on  
matters of royal bounty with deep earnest anxiety - But what are the  
comments & coats? in comparison of with the British bounties, we have  

have received in this colony under the reign of King George Charlotte.  
We have been snatched from the grasp of oppression, and of Slave  
dealers; from the jaws of heathen superstition and misery. Your  
Charlotte would proclaim the bounty of Bristish—man our prayers  

that to give utterance to discontentment—The stern  
to us solemness as a civil duty but it is an ef-  
inflexion in the Compound of our holy religion—  
What a Cheering Thought that it maketh up the breach with the  

making he hath brought light & immortality to light by the gospel.  
On the occasion we may put the perfect wreath in black & crown  
the seat is with our trusty boonhaps & truest Effort of a respectable  
European Gentleman and with green Bays. For the honour  

I owe many polite Complements by many respectable persons  
present. But I am aware that these human praises are    
husks upon which I cannot feed. VMy Object will be attained if  
goods accrue to the Mission. That brethren who beareth  

I enjoy a very good state of health—have been  
under the necessity of purchasing our horse at as many high  
rates as with funds I did not attain the places wh now form an  
little errand of wch I sent you a statement in last letters  

I have been under the necessity of drawing upon you for £50  
of any need you should have a statement of all is well & best  
respects Write kind regards to Mrs Mardon & the family  
Your excellent Committee I am my clear friend Sir & brother
