Rev'd dear Father

I am thankful in sitting down to write you to be able to say I am still well & happy in God. Our claims up to the present time have been very favorable indeed, I should their continuance be the same the sickness of this year will by no means be like the last year â€” I sat yesterday from Morning till night making up my accounts which brought on such a violent Head Ache as I have this morning hardly any of. The people said to any of this year, but my friend Mr. Tichard who I believe will call with it. He certainly has been very kind to me here, which will I trust be remembered with gratitude. This letter must be filled with various particulars as tho I could write sheets full yet I really have not had time to get it ready. In reference to Amose, he is a lad Mr. Browne took from just into our hands for Boys Town & I expect Mr. Browne had given an account of him to you. Amose is about 17 Years of Age & I believe truly fears God. He can read the Bible pretty well & writes a plain hand. He has 20 Children in his School, but as the People of the town are all pagans their Children are small. I tho they do very well in reference to the Prophet, yet it is in the first Rudiments. I could have that Boy with me I think as he certainly has a good capacity to learn. I should soon be able to bring him forward, but where he is now without an additional Missionary this is impracticable I am often sorry for him as he seems very anxious to learn. I intend he shall write home & indeed I believe he is preparing a letter for that purpose. John Wannen was a Boy taken by Mr. Bovway [unreadable] one of the Slave Ships & he remained 7 Years in the Mission, but was not regularly bound Mr. Browne promised to bind him to a Trade & a few Months after we came here he went & then I was obliged to find him according to custom here some Clothes. I really never considered him my Servant, but [unreadable] were before me. In reference to the Brethren who are coming their time cannot be better spent than in getting a knowledge of Arabic Roots, as it will help them here greatly. In this Country Mahomedans have all the obstinacy of a Micea Priest without his learning. We have in Portuguese Town about 6 of them & they are certainly the most obstinate ignorant People I ever met with. I intend sending to desire Mr. Blanchard to send me Prideaux' Life of Mahomet Sale's Translation of the Koran with Seighik in the [unreadable]
