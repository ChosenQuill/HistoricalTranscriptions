Sierra Leone Augst 18th 1818

My dear Sir

I wrote Mr. Blanchard about two months
since when I was under the influence of fever, since
which time I have had several different attacks
but am so far restored as to be able to attend to
my duties. The rains have already proved very [unreadable]
and fatal, the Church Mission has lost 4 persons
connected with their Mission, and many are and
have been sick. The persons who have died are
Rev'd W. Garnon first Chaplain, Rev'd Mr. Wenzel, Mrs.
Harker & Mrs. Collier. I trust by the blessing of providence
and prudential means to be able to overcome the un-
healthy nature of the climate. but all are mine; life or
death as seemeth best to him, who doeth whatsoever it
pleaseth him in heaven above and on Earth beneath.
I am very desirous of having a Colleague or two. There is
plenty of work for two, and I think the lasting good of the Mission
requires that there should be at least that number employd
upon it. They would be society for each other, guardian Angels
to one another, or Constitute a body of evidence which is very
necessary both for the comfort of an honest Missionary and
the Committee; for when one is alone (as has been even my case
here in africa) he gives honest statements, and he doing
the work of the lord faithfully; but his circumstances, may
lay him open to temptations, which may prove ruinous to
his own soul, and the souls, over which he is appointed
to watch.
I do trust I have an honest conscience willing to
spend my days, and expense my members in righteousness,
being assured that the judge is at the door and my final
account will be soon settled. I never have felt a backwardness to
speak of myself and my work; but situated as I am
I shall not do justice if I entirely omit these things. I have
pleasure in preaching among the heathen those unsearch-
able riches of Christ; those truths which I believe are
not wholly unfelt, but have a cheering influence upon
my own heart; and I trust my preaching is not solely
with the wisdom of words; but has some demonstration.
