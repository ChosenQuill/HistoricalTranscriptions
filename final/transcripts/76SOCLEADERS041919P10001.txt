Sierra Leone 14th Apr. 1819.

Rev. Fathers & Brethren,

In Per Leaders of the mission  
Society gives you expression of thanks for the labours  
that his Rev. the Rev. Mr. Brown  
whom you kindly sent us who are as deeply at a  

loss for words to express our gratitude to you  
in continuing him so long amongst us. The  
annual[s] of your permission for him to leave  
has afforded us but little comfort. Had we  

the means & was he but willing to spend his  
life here, we would not have consented to  
return him to you as soon as for his comf[ort].  
He has been an unwearied labourer in his Master's   

cause. He has been the happy means under god  
of assisting & urging his captivesâ€™ people to  
fall in with the terms of marriage as offered  
in the gospel. Like a signal in the field of  
slaughter commanding numerous Tabalones [etc.]
