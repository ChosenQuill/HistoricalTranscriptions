And agood Scotch Cloak and to ruffe coat, and   
sleep very great services, at the east is unwanted, now   
coming out of sickness, and a Scotch Cloak ut   
going into the Rain, which is lighter & collects the   
   
than the former. It is now the 29th I am much better   
tho extremely weak. I could preach but once yesterday   
and then I almost fainted in the middle of the service   
I am now confined to one Room & that one leaks in   
5 or 6 places, in such a State is our House, it will cost   
a considerable sum of Money to put it in tenable repair   
when the day’s commence. This Station is I know   
expensive, & I really fear that with but 2 Missionar   
   
this Station will all things considered be equally as great   
if not greater than 5. If you should see proper not   
to lay out a little money in building necessary, such   
as a House at Cape town and a Schoolhouse here in   
Town for Boys & Girls and supply them with a little   
   
at first: there would then be an opportunity and   
fair one, to see if good might not be done   
but were as soon as we begin a scale of labour   
that being to speak one of the other falls, which is   
just the Case now, and then we have to do what   
I fear on the present plan cannot but be   
cure. Always beginning, hoping soon to receive   
   
you the agreeable news of the appointment of the   
first Missionaries for this Station I remain,   
yours very respectfully   
L affectionately   
   
P. S. By this goes a Bill in favour of   
Capt Strange for £150, which [unreadable] you wil
