28                   Free Town Sierra Leone March 31st 
                                 1827 -
Rev d Sir
I am happy to inform you, that after
passing through the seasoning sickness (as it is generally called)
we are fully recovered and enjoy good health.

I have received the tickets for the March quarter we have
115 Members and 24 on trial 8 of whom form a Class which Mrs.
Brown has taken in Charge.

The experience of the members is in general scriptural and
rational some are very confident and I could wish that confidence
united with a more humble temper; but every reasonable allowance
may be made for people who have not had equal privileges
with europeans.

I have made some exertions to extend our sphere of labour
we have a small Wattled Meeting house in Portuguese Town
nearly finished and 2 admitted on trial who are the seeds of
the first Country Society, belonging to us in the Colony.
The population of the above place is near 200 and is upon the
increase.

Here, in Soldiers Town (where all the Black soldiers live) I have
begun to Preach every Thursday evening. I stand in middle of the
Town in the open Air; my congregation is from 50 to 100 who are
very attentive. This is a place publickly noted for the worst
of kinds. I have proposed for them to build a wattled Meeting
house and they have given their names to subscribe to the
amount of Â£2-15-3. and the building will cost about 5-0-0
These two Meeting houses will answer a double purpose
that of a Meeting house & School also.

I have visited most of the Towns (or more properly they maybe
called Villages) in the principal of which there are fixed
superintendants who is Minister Magistrate School Master
and Householder for the village in which he resides.

It is the Church Missionaries or School Masters who
have to sustain these several offices. Half of their salaries
is paid by government & the other half by the Church Missionary
society.

In Regents Town the population is about 1200 Mr. Johnson
formerly a member of Doctor Steinkopff Church is a zealous and
active Christian and some there are under a true concern
for their souls salvation.

The schools (I think) are not in as prosperous a state as
is generally expected at home. The superintendant's attention
is too much engaged by the temporal concerns of his station.
