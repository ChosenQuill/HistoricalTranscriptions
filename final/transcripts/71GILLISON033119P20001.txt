But not only in town, but in the  
country the Lord is carrying on  
his glorious work the country  
places are inhabited chiefly by  
people who have been taken out of  

the slave ships.  
On the 21st June I went to one of these  
places called [unreadable] town to preach  
The chapel was full and the Lord was  
present While I was preaching first  

one and then another would praise  
god while joy beamed in their countenances.  
after preaching I met a class and [unreadable]  
what blessed experience and after  

I had renewed the tickets There were  
9 who wanted to [unreadable] God as they  
call it One man in particular who  
I saw sat at the door of his hut as  

I was going to preach he was almost  
naked I said to him Daddy how do  
do so this be sunday why you no  
put your trousers on and come to  

meeting he immediately put on  
his trousers and come during the  
time of preaching he was anxious to  
catch every word and after preaching  

he come to me and said he want to meet  
in class he said he could do devil fashions  
no more  
when I came home one man come along  

with me part of the way he met  
with another man who was taken out  
of the same ship as himself when  

The following conversation took place  
O! my fellow countryman you never  
come see me unaware I'm live or where  
you live he then pointed out to him

The place saying Jesus Christ he set  
the mark upon me I be the sheep man  
I want you to have the mark too  
The same man said at another time to  

some men again be blind all the same  
suppose a man be blind he eye he never  
walken at piece of blenk but to be blenk  
no so yes you no see god like Devel  

he tell you white man come to get  
copper and make you fool but e devil  
he tell afore so kill the get you  
in hell and then he laugh at you  

another calls Jesus his Doctor he says  
because he has cured his soul  
As it respects myself I feel  
my heart is in this glorious work  
I shall not have my billet but thank  

God I have my sweeten because the  
sun sometimes affects my head but  
Jesus head was crowned with thorns  

when I suffer I have a God to support  
me but Jesus bore his fathers wrath  
alone yea in all things the servant  
is above his lord I do not and believe  

I never shall repent coming to  
Africa thank god there is a work  
wrought here which is worth all  
the money that has been expended  

yea and ought the afflictions and death  
that has been experienced humbly  
depending upon your prayer may we behove  
to meet at what would as to grave  

your unworthy but affectionate  
Son in the Gospel  
My love to Mrs Taylor  
and family
