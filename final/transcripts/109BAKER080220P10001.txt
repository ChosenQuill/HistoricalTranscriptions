Rev’d & dear Father,

I feel a considerable degree
of reluctance in sitting down to write this letter
fearing lest what I have to say might lead you
to suppose I wished to retire from the Missionary
Work; but I would begin by assuring you (as God
knoweth) this is a thing the farthest from my thoughts
& wishes - nor do I wish to be removed from this
Coast if you wish me to stay as long as my health will
at all admit of my remaining. I would also observe
that in reference to what I am about to ask, I wish
to leave myself in the hands of my dear Father, & doubt
not which way ever this may decide I shall find that
it is right. I shall first state what I have to request
then state my reasons for making that request.
It is this, I wish to obtain leave to return home, as
soon as I have seen Dr. Oliver settle here & Dr. Walker
at St. Mary's. I stay in England till the Plains of Nov’r &
I return to this Coast as soon as they are over, that is to
start from thence latter end of Nov’r or Dec’r.

But while at home I wish to obtain leave to marry
& then I should be quite willing to return here for 3 years
more if health would at all permit, or then remove to
some station in the West Indies, or even stay here longer
as would then appear to be most for the glory of God. If he
should to that time spare my life.

My reasons for asking this are
1st. My health requires that before a third Rains I should
remove to another climate, as I could not stay here this time
but at the imminent risk of life, or of what is still worse
a Dropsy or Dysentery which would make me at once a useless
burden, a thing I should dread more than death.

It is true at present I am able to do all my work, & look
(with the exception of being thin) quite well, but I really feel
that my Constitution is shaken to the Centre; & I am obliged
to be very cautious as every little exertion out of my common
course, quite overpowers me.
My Nervous system is so arranged that every little trifle alarms
me, the starting of my horse, or the unexpected remark of a
Market throws me into such agitation, that it is not

sometimes soon for hours. The fever has also very much
impaired my memory, so much so, that I frequently forget
my public duties & this, & when I have the eye upon the 
point of my fingers my career.
