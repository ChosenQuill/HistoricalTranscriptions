My dear Sir

I have taken earnest, expecting for 
the last 2 months a fellow labourer and was rather 
disappointed on 29 Oct'r when our dear Friend, Captain 
Gowp arrived, without any missionary to join me; but my disappointment was partly relieved by the 
pleasing information that two young men are actually 
engaged to come, and will arrive by the earliest opportunity. 
I am under the greatest obligations to the Committee 
for the earnest care they have of the church of God 
abroad, yet as I am now committed to the 
solitary in the worst howling wilderness of Africa 
every additional act of kindness is like the new rising splendour of the sun, which scatters darkness, revives the human 
spirits and calls forth the energies of body & mind into full 
exercise.

Oh my Dear Sir, how changeable is the world? Since I 
came to Africa, I have suffered from all quarters, but 
now I have the misfortune of being author, publisher 
and clerk. I sustain the office of President to the poor 
Society, & joint Secretary with the Chaplains to the Bible Society. 
I delivered a speech at our annual meeting, first Tuesday in the year, and was highly complimented on the occasion. On 
Sunday 10 Feb. inst. at 6 P.M. I preached a sermon at the request of the Govt., on the lamented death of the Queen. 
His Excellency Gov'r MacCarthy, his Honor the Chief Justice, the 
Honorable T.F. Buchele, the military & civil officers, the 
magistrates, mayor & aldermen, & merchants attend 
chapel on the occasion.
