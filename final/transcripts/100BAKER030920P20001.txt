Fatal to my already broken Constitution.  
I have sent home my accounts up to Christmas Day & I hope they will  
prove satisfactory. Every Penny of this  

& all other Monies I drew on the  
Committee shall be satisfactorily  
accounted for. My dear Father will  
please honour this Bill, and as soon  

as the Roof is finished which will be I hope in a Month. I will send  
home my accounts again to you  
I trust ever to avoid the returning of  

Bills drawn for my own acct  
As I shall write more particulars by  
the Vessel sailing direct from hence  
I shall only add I thank God I am  

so well as to enable me to do all  
my work tho I know not what the  
effects of health are such as I enjoy-  
ed at home. yet I thank God I am  
happy in my work  

& find it a present reward  
I am willing to stay here or go  
any where else you wish to send me  
as I only wish to be in my place  

and therefore do not wish to make  
any choice. I have now given up  
the thought of having any help before  
the Rains nor do I indeed wish them  

to come as the Season is so far gone  
their risk would be a great deal more  
& other gloomy things in anticipation  

that of having my house  

be a robber. It has been twice  
at the house in the next Lot broken  
open & robd of many things. I have  
been obliged to provide myself with  

Arms. tho I hope never to have to use  
them. A thing I should not do except  
my life was in danger, but a know  

ledge of my having them will I hope  
frighten them from again attempting  
the same. I remain dear Father yours  
respectfully & affectionately  
J. Baker
