Herewith I send you the Account of my  
Expenditure since June last. You will perceive that I  
was obliged to draw upon you for 50£ Sterling. I  
understand that the leaders & stewards have written to  
the committee respecting my mode of living, think-  
ing it would be better for the committee to allow  
me a certain Sum annually which they agreed  
upon. I do not exactly know as I would not  
be present when the matter was discussed at the  
Quarterly M. for my part I shall leave the matter  
entirely to your consideration but must say I  
would prefer a certain sum as it means less  
be both trouble to me and to the committee.  
I wish under the necessity of laying out your money in a way  
the entirely to the benefit of the people who  
had been waiting I will write when the Chapel which  
will be an aged but as I have gathered about 20£ by  
the many already and must either enlarge the district  
if possible a new chapel of next dry season  
were unless in the sound is as there is a  
loud or so is in both the place 'tis very apparent
