of the week. The Congregation on Sunday  
is usually larger than the place can  
accommodate. It consists of Nova-  

Scotians, Maroons, and recaptured Negroes  
from other places. Often has my mind been much pained the  
the bounds of our decayed wooden meeting house  
could not seat all who anxiously came to  

hear the word of life. Many persons for the  
forenoon on the Sabbath were obliged to sit around its outside  
in the scorching heat of the sun in the dry  
year. This meeting house is at the head of our  

mission; here our recaptured people from the  
villages attend on sabbath mornings and  
influence by the cleanly habits of some  
Nova Scotians and Maroons make an  

appearance for decency that does honour  
to the religion they profess. And here they  
are brought more intimately into union  
with our society and have further opportunity  

of improvement. The Congregation on the  
week evening consists of a portion of the  
same description of hearers and generally  
fills the body of the meeting house.  

Amongst my pleasant  
labours I may rank the lectures which  
I gave twice a week to Children, Appren-  
tices and Servants of all descriptions, and often  
I meet at the Mission House on Sundays

and the greater part on Monday evening.  
The number on Sundays was from 12 to 20  
and on Monday evening from 60 to 120.

The West end of Free Town is  
chiefly inhabited by the Maroons and Recaptured  
Negroes. With a design to awaken a spirit of inquiry  
in the dry season of 1818 I preached on Sunday

morning, alternately in the streets at the East  
and West end of the Town, and visited most  
of the inhabitants from house to house. Some  
good arose from it to my own mind and

to the souls of my hearers. Several recaptured  
families became our constant hearers and  
are now members of our society. In the East

of one at this end of the Town we preach  
twice a week & hold a prayer meeting and  
The Brethren have formed a promising  
class at the same place.

Congo Town is so called from  
its inhabitants chiefly consisting of Recaptured  
Negroes from the River Congo about 3 or 4  
degrees south of the Equator. Its population,

taking in the scattered huts in the neighbourhood,  
may be averaged at from three to four hundred  
Adults, exclusive of many Children. About  

the middle of 1818 I took them wholly under  
my care and by the help of the leaders  
visited them three times a week.
