Rev & Dear Sir

           The bearer Mr. James
Wise Merchant having been several
years about five years [unreadable] the direction
will be able to give you general 
information on any subject that relates 
to this Mission.

           I therefore refer you to him
and Mr. Thomas Hurst formerly your
School Master in this place. Respecting
their Moral Character I know nothing
that is to their Credit

They have been useful in 
assisting me to instruct the [illegible]
people in the country villages and
in carrying on the Sunday School which
we had, but have now suspended for
want of an outfit of Books - better
accommodations & assistance. 
                                                      (over)
