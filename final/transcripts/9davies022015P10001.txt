Copy of a Letter from Wm. A. Daniel dated Free Town  
My Dear Sir,
		Sierra Leone 20 Feb 1815.
		Rev. Dr. J. Bunting
	
	Thank God we arrived safely in this 
Colony on Monday 13th inst. We had a pleasant voyage from 
The Cove of Cork. We stopped there about 9 days, 3 days at 
Madeira, & a week at Goree, where we met with great 
kindness & hospitality from the English Residents. Capt. 
Gibson was very kind to us during the voyage. On Monday even= 
I waited on his Excellency Dr. Purdue the acting Governor, & 
on Tuesday at 7 o'clock, I preached to a large congregation. 
After the meeting was over I met the Steward, Leaders, & Trustees 
and read to them the Resolutions of the Mssrs. Com. concerning 
this place, which met with their approbation. Yesterday 
Morning, at 9, I read the Church Prayers, & preached, at 12, read 
& preached again at 6, to a large congregation. I 
expect to see good days in this Colony, for many of this Society 
are truly alive to God & walking worthy of the vocation &c. 
In looking over the Class papers I found in general that 
the members met well, but as yet cannot speak with 
accuracy as to the state of Religion in this Colony. 

When we arrived here the Brethren Healey & Flausit had taken 
their passage in a Brig bound for London. They had been at 
sea a month, but the ship having sprang a leak, they 
were obliged to put back again into this harbour. They 
had had the Government Salary taken from them & 
at hearing from the Com gave up the School. As these re= 
solutions of the Com. are for them to remain here & go on with 
their work untill I hear from you. The Society petitioned Mr. 
Hamilton to return the passage Money, but his answer was 
that he had laid in provisions for the voyage & it would 
not therefore be doing justice to himself to return it. Now 
as Mr. Healey had suffered much from the climate & it is in 
the opinion of all here that he could not stand another 
wet season, I thought it best for him to return & for 
Mr. Flust to stop and go on with the School. He has 
his health very well since he has been in this placeâ€”
It appears to me our Schoolmasters have been very useful 
in this place. Many of the Boys have got as far in 
Arithmetic as the Rule of Three, & can read & write tolerably 
well. As the school is calculated to do good, & as the Me= 
thodists have been as useful as any who have made the 
attempt, I think it our duty to carry on the School; consequently 
it will be opened this day week. They have
