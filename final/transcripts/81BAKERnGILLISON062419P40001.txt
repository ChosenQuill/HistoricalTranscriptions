I found them, unmarried, unbaptized, sunk  
in superstition, fornication and every vice  
suggested the necessity of keeping them on trial  
from six to eighteen months till their knowled-  
ge was enlarged and their conduct bespoke  

sincerity. In the latter end of Nov 1817 several  
who had evidently been for some time in deep  
distress for their sins, made a clear and satis-  

factory profession of having found forgiveness of sins  
by the redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ. One  
whose name is John Brown came to the Mission  
house and said "he was come to tell me what God  

had done for his soul, that when I baptized  
his child (which had taken place about four weeks)  
conviction seized his mind, that he had prayed  
in the bush, in his house or where-ever he might  

be for the Lord Jesus to forgive his sins, that every  
thing bad that he had done came to his recollection.  
That his trouble was so great that he could neither  
eat nor sleep, that his wife and former company  

frequently questioned him as to what burdened his  
mind and urged him to eat and not give way  
to trouble, that when he had been at prayer in  
a retired place in the Bush and was returning  

home he felt a sudden change pass upon his  
mind, his trouble went away and gladness filled  
his heart; that this good thing which he felt was  
sweet, that in his own Country he had eaten honey  

and in whatmond (Isera hore is so called by the exception of negroes) sugar, but this putting his hand to his breast  
is sweeter than all: that since his mother bore him  
he never felt the same; that if the Gov. had given him  
plenty of shops full of cloth his heart could not  

feel as glad as it did. Oh (said) I thank God for this  
good thing, that ever he brought me into this country  
and that he may ever keep this good thing on my  
heart." This man has been preserved and made  

very useful to the society which consists of about  
thirty members and the same number on trial.  
The conversion of many others  
is equally clear and  
satisfactory. At the present time, we have a new  

wattled meeting house (as the first after standing  
two years sunk into decay) built chiefly by their  
own exertions. It is generally filled by a congregation  
from fifty to an hundred and fifty. The Brethren  

Baker and Gillison have joined me in bearing  
testimony to the pleasure which it always affords to  
visit this society, the hearts of the members of which  
abound with love and gratitude to God and their  
ministers.  

Portugue Town, takes its  
name from the majority of the inhabitants having  
been rescued from the Portuguese in the beginning  
of February 1817 I first visited this town and by  
ringing a small bell collected the inhabitants, to  
whom under the side of one of her huts in the open  
air I published the truths of the gospel. The hearers  

were attentive and my congregation was usually  
from thirty to sixty. On the 13th April I opened a  
wattled meeting house in the village and by the help  
of the leaders held meetings three times a week.  

Two females appeared concerned for their salvation  
whom I put under the care of an experienced Christian.  
On May 5th, 1817 I commenced a day school. Had  
twenty-nine attended and seemed anxious
