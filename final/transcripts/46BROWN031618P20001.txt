of the Mission or my own comfort.  
Another reason is I have no person  
to attend to the concerns of the house  
my own comfort either of Body or  

mind. If I was to engage an housekeeper  
it would cost at least 50 Â£ per Anm. These  
are these reasons which are plain and  
weighty. But in this and other matters  

which relate to myself or the Mission  
I am desirous of attending to the providence  
of God and the instructions which my  
kind and respectable Fathers who compose  
the Committee may communicate.  

I am Revd & Dear Sir  
your Servant in  
the Gospel

Stewards will be able to furnish you with  
some information respecting this Mission  
My kind regards to Mrs. Entrusted & Family.
