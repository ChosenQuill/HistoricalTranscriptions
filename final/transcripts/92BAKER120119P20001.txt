To go back to the Origin of it. When we arrived here, we
found Mr. Browne building the Chapel, and upon enquiry
about the Money, was told he said, the People had promised
us some, and the Committee would pay the rest. 

I must acknowledge tho it goes much against my inclina-
tion to say any thing against a Brother in the Ministry
yet my own Character being concerned I feel it my
duty I did not think it a high application of these 60 
grants for female Schools; yet, as our advice was not asked
on the business we did not attempt either of us to dictate.
The Chapel went on under his direction till the walls
were up. By this time he had a large Bill to pay 

for work & the 60 was gone. He was now upon the point of
going home & there was no Money. He wished me to pay 
this Money out of that which Capt. Reeve had given us for our 
first Bill. He said he would go home and state the case of
the Chapel & get things into a train & then I could draw; but
he wished no Bills to go home before or with him.
Upon this I paid the money and went on with the 
work expecting all would be right till I wanted that
money & then I drew the Bill — so that it will be 
seen part of this 60 Bill was never expended by me.
I do not know exactly the sum I paid as I deducted the Chapel 
with the same in my regular accounts, but I know
it was the greater part of £50. And as to no letter being 

sent. Mr. Browne was my letter to you & more than 
as he was pleading for his own actions, and, as a 
letter I did not think I had to wait for an answer 
would most certainly have done it. I must say I
wrote Mr. Browne one letter about it, and especially of the man-
ner in which I was placed. Mr. Browne says in his 
letter in the February Magazine the People had given
£20. Of this he never collected a Penny, and this I asked 
him for it, yet he went away without giving me a 
list of the Subscribers (Names); and I have not been able 
to find our People to any thing like such an amount  
nor has there been a Penny of this sum received 

It is true the Station is of great importance in 
many respects but I acknowledge I should never have 
thought so of consequence enough to begin of myself to
build a Chapel without your consent first obtained 
had the £20 had been put into my hand instead of 

being promised; as such an sum is comparatively nothing 
in building here. I appeal to my Conduct in instances 
of this kind, to clear me before you. That a School House
was wanted, & all here know a Frame House is cheaper
than a Wattled one, yet in my letter to you about that 
I observed, we should wait for your answer before I began
to build. To this I never had any Answer yet. I have indi-
cated done what the Rule requires in reference to our Chapel informa-
And in my last which will accompany this I have stated  

ly every thing to your better judgement and only stated 
facts and offered my opinion. Surely all these things
will prove the blame is not mine. I send your
letter to 2 or 4 of the most respectable leaders and there

all agree in advising me to place the blame where it belongs 
My dear Brothers know I have no hundred Pounds to pay, 
I have nothing but my Character which I hope you 
will never stain, by returning a Bill for faults not 
mine. Had I begun the Chapel, or not laid on, as I have 
done I should have expected it. There is now remaining 
a debt of something more than £200 which money 
I have borrowed, and a Bill for which I hope my dear 
Brothers will not refuse, at least till they write me 
again. If you will not hear me: I have no other 
alternative but either to go to Prison or give the Chapel 
to the Governor which I should very reluctantly do 
The Land is not yet granted, but the Governor wishes 
that Lot, and the Lot for the Home then, and the Lot 
in Bathurst Street to be granted to me, and for me 
to grant it to Trustees for the use of the Conference. 
I have parsimoniously laid out every Penny that 
has been spent and the best judges say I have 
saved £50. Many days have I been balancing these 
and have been so burthened I have not been able to 
sleep after coming home, yet I considered nothing more 
than my duty. Nor if should it happen (which I 
sincerely it will not) to fall into the hands of the Governor 
would I take any thing more for it than it cost me: 
it would still be used for a place of worship & 
would find a Church Missionary there, but 
should this lose the Station, and I am sure 
our credit here. I hope this never will be 
Hoping to hear from you as soon as you 
can make it convenient. I remain dear Brothers 
yours Respectfully and Affectionately

P. S. In reference to Bills of 2 Months I 
cannot get them Cashed here, it is not a Colony 
Bill, nor was drawn here besides in Cases where 
the creditor pushes hard & the Debtor can join him, 
nothing else. There are so many Public Works and 
Soldiers that the Colony teems with Bills, and all 
the Church Missionary Society draws at 30 days. 
So that really I am compelled to continue mine 
at the same [unreadable] date. 

The repairs of the house will exceed I expect £100 
as the whole roof is rotten and it would be im- 
possible to live in the house next Rains without 
a new Roof. We suffered greatly from its bad state 
these last. 

The Agency is arrived brings me yours of Oct 28th 
The Plans astonish me but I bow to your 
superior judgment
