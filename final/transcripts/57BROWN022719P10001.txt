Extract of a letter  
from Mr. J. Brown 
dated Sierra Leone, February 27th 1879 â€” 

On Sunday the 23rd Instant, at 8.30  
A.M. the Ship "Bowron" arrived in the harbour of  
Sierra Leone, I in company with our dear friend  
Captain Dowes, went on board, and was highly  
gratified by meeting with Messrs. Baker & Gillison in  
health and safety. From the Ship we went to the  
Chapel, where, after I had read prayers, Mr. Baker  
preached for us, and in the evening Mr. Gillison.  
It is truly pleasing to myself and our members to  
receive an increase of Missionary labours to this part of  
the world; and what is infrequently more uncertain  
it is pleasing to God, well timed. Oh! that their  
health and life may be spared; that they from our  
enriched & overflowing hearts, may ever lift their  
hearts out of Zion in the name of the Lord.  
It affords me very great pleasure to state, that for  
the last three or four months we have had a gradual &  
continued revival of the good work of the Lord. During  
which from twenty to thirty have been clearly converted.  
They are chiefly recaptured negroes in the soldier's frontier  
towns, and the suburbs of Free Town. Their experience  
is very clear. They have been awakened, struggled into  
liberty by the exercise of faith & prayer; and rejoice  
in a full assurance of the love of God. They literally  
flock to the meetings like doves to their windows, the  
females with their children on their backs in their  
clean & best attire. Often do they bless God for having  
been sold by their countrymen, and been brought to this  
part of the world, to hear God's word and find the forgiving  
of their sins by the redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
One man, a private in the Company, used to be  
much addicted to gambling, drinking, fighting; when at first  
visited their towns, I often had to disperse different companies.
