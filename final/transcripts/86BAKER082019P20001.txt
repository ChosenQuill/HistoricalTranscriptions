[unreadable] I stood by [unreadable] signs of approaching delirium; I  
[unreadable] myself, weak as I was, into his room as  
I much wished to inquire into the state of his feelings  
When I came he would be helped up in Bed, and  
we seemed like two dear friends meeting who had long  
been separated. I immediately asked if Jesus precious  
to you? he sweetly answered yes, glory be to God  
he is, he spent a little time in talking of the love of our  
Immanuel in [unreadable] which he joined with the utmost  
intensity, when presently after I found his delirium  
sensibly increased and in a short time his Reason was  
quite gone. By this time I was quite exhausted and  
was helped back to my room and obliged to retire to bed  
but in 2 or 3 hours after I was alarmed with the mournful  
intelligence that he was dying, in a few minutes there  
came to tell me if I wished to see the last I must  
make haste. I directly had my nurse to help me up  
& when helped I was again helped into his Room it  
thought then he was just going, he had (what is here  
termed) the death hickups, his eyes were fixed  
and glassy, and every appearance of death seemed  
to be upon him except his poor burning skin;  
and tho he again revived yet I am certain that  
was the time the disease took its fatal turn in  
the system, as from this time he sensibly changed  
where he had not changed before. I asked him next  
morning at short intervals of Reason, [unreadable] if he knew  
anything of the preceding day, he said it was at the  
he had slept. I again inquired and found him ever  
happy in God & prepared for his [unreadable], and in all the  
intervals of Reason he expressed himself  
in the same [unreadable]. On Tuesday Morning I was so much  
exerted that by the advice of the Surgeon I [unreadable] a short  
[unreadable] as Mr. Beecham during my short absence became some  
any more rational than before. The Surgeon [unreadable] the  
use that when Friday [unreadable] the fatal strife ensued [unreadable] became  
a small dose of [unreadable] every hour, but this was the last  
struggle for life, in an hour all his bad symptoms utterly  
[unreadable] but the [unreadable], his understanding [unreadable] amazing  
end no every [unreadable] that he [unreadable] peaceful. In the deadly  
could not distinguish his last breath. Thus died my  
worthy and affectionate Colleague & one of Christ's faithful  
Minister! his loss is much lamented by all the  
Congregations to whom he preached. he was one acceptable  
& preacher to their People & much respected by them.  
His remains were interred the following day. after  
I went to Chapel & performed that part of the service  
but the Rain was so heavy I could not possibly  
proceed to the yard, where the Revd Mr. Browne

the present Chaplain kindly offered to give  
you my dear Father some books as I still continue  
I am a Missionary and I am companion in distress here  
Here I am just like a sparrow alone to man. I am  
tho, so weak that I cannot walk the length of our  
Prayer 4 or 5 times without fatigue and my fear  
that gone has laid the foundation of two bad nights  
The Spleen & Liver, the former of which is weak & can  
only be kept down by the use of Calomel in the  
Climates; and the taking of this deleterious drug is  
attended with evils, when taking it I must keep on  
a good & not able to go out to man labour, and I have  
already taken so much of it in the fever that my  
very teeth are decaying; but I am thankful, it is  
not my own work I have to do, and my strength  
must see to my strength. This season has proved most  
dreadful indeed, there has not been such an one for  
Rains and Sickness since 1839. The Europeans in the  
Colony exceed 900 hundred but how much I do not know  
I know a little before me sent me by a gentleman in  
the Colony of the deaths of 58 adults & 44 Children  
Spanish and any weather is I am told for June  
it; so that we know not who or how many  
7 girls be saved & the number is that season arises  
first it would be (humanly speaking) a miracle if  
lived over such another Rains as these: but not trust  
here I am happy in some way that our try will be  
done And I thought after dark a mournsful relation  
as this shall it be said by those whose names are enrolled  
on the list of Foreign Missionaries; who have proved  
themselves to go into distant lands to engage in the  
war against Heathenish Superstition & Idolatry, opposed  
together + Satanic influence & torture. It may be  
hope that I may & that there are many who from  
a desire to proclaim Saviour we all say it is a holy I  
send one to live up the names of the fallen. Nor  
can I suppose there are any whose constitution is better  
you to send forth Missionaries who will say I cannot  
spare any more money to send Ministers through ready  
and also know English liberality & the series of examples  
Christian to well, to think that either there are men  
+ be found who are ready to sacrifice their acts of  
earthly comfort and brave every danger; they will be  
backward in supplies to send such. It is true many  
Missionary who lines lines must not only be prepared to die  
but willing too; if called to it. Here we may truly need  
"Death work inside"  
Danger stands thick thro all the ground Prepared to take  
man whose wait around to hurry must on home
