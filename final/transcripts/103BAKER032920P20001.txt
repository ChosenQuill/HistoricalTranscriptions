much respect paid me by those who are at the head   
of affairs. But I know while I am enabled thro'   
grace to walk uprightly, I have nothing to fear   
from their influence. Thank God I have to say   
that he has given me favour in sight of my superi-  

ors. The Governor is so friendly, almost as if my   
equal. I shakes hands when he meets me with the  
greatest freedom. And his Honour the Judge has  
so often & so openly shown respect, that it has been  

remarked by others. And what it is for I know   
not, if they any of them come to hear me, I   
never go out of my regular way, of being as plain   
& faithful as I can, to please them. I God forbid I   
ever should, tho at the same time I always endeavour  

them to avoid anything that would seem pointed.   
Perhaps it may be in some measure, from my having   
at all times avoided entering into the Politics of this   
Colony, & this I consider it my duty always to avoid.   
And I see that some who had no more business with it than me, by medling with it and ma-  

king free with the private Characters of their superiors   
are very much neglected & despised. With their Cha-   
racters I conceive I have not the least right to   

meddle no more than I have to unclose any thing   
because he might be a wicked Man. There are   
now a large host of Church Missionaries here, but   
I am alone. I hope I am not forgotten in your   

Prayers, that I may ever be kept at all times.   
Remember me this July, August & Sept.r. Months   
of wet & distress here. I have now of necessity bought  
a horse, as without it I can no longer do my work   
an account of which will come in my next.

Your request about the Bills shall be in future  
attended too. My feelings on the return of the  
Bills I cannot now describe & I forbear to make  
any further remarks on the same, as you will  

see what I have said in a former letter to which  
I am awaiting an answer & then I trust I shall  
find that you see where the blame lyes. I have  
written Mr. Browne on it & I found dealt very  

plain with him, & desire him to avoid involving  
himself in such unpleasant  
circumstances. The Person who is the bearer of this,  
has been here about 12 months & is the only firm  
friend I have had to converse with, of my own  

Colour since the death of my dear Colleague.  
I beg leave to recommend him as a Christian to,  
friendly regards, he will be able to answer any  
questions you may wish to put respecting the  
Colony & situation. He is a member of R.st Hill  

tho are the difference in sentiment for that  
been no hindrance to us being a mutual help to  
each other. If my dear Fathers will favour me with  
a letter answering this various questions I have from  

time to time had to ask, and their candid opinion  
on my views as stated on various subjects I shall  
feel most particularly obliged. I trust I am ever  
open to conviction, not opposed to receiving instruc  

tion or reproof if it be necessary & therefore hope my  
dear Fathers will speak freely, as it may assist me  
in many ways which it is likely they may. It  
will be a source of instruction in future.  

Yours very respectfully & affectionately  

Baker
