We have five different places at which we regularly preachâ€”two in Free Town and three in country villages which are entirely inhabited by recaptured Negroes.

At the east end of Free Town stands our principal Meeting House which is a Board building with a grass thatched roof fitted up with Benches

excepting one temporary Pew which joins the Pulpit. It may when crowded contain from three to four hundred hearers. We have Freehold land sufficient on which

to build both a commodious Chapel and Preachers house. The foundations of a Chapel 65 by 40 are laid and stones prepared which cost one hundred pounds. that had

been collected by Mr. Davies. In addition, we have since collected upwards of one hundred pounds more which is now on hand.

We preach in this Meeting House twice on Sundays give a lecture to children on Monday evening and preach on Wednesday evening: and hold prayer meetings every morning & two evening in the week.
