Rev'd & dear Sir

Sincere house August 3rd 1818 

after a long interlace I again take up my Pen to
address you. I hope you will not think that the reason of my not
writing you before, was because I had received no answer to the last
I sent: it is true I have been expecting a letter from you, but it
is merely by expecting that the next I next. This would bring it for the
last 5 or 6 Months past. that I have delayed writing expecting you here
would from Brother for my answer. Letters I can assure you Sir
coming from our at home, are things highly valued by me in this
Land; but when they come from those who are well engaged on here
by the profession of their kind wishes for our welfare, & at the same
time, afford us such instruction, as becomes a blessing to us, they are
doubly valuable. it is a letter of the latter description I have been 
expecting from you Sir, not that I conceive I have by any means any 
claims on you, further than that of a Father in Christ, who I am sure 
feels happy at all times, to afford instruction to such as like 
myself are but Babes in Divine Knowledge. Many times since I first 
come here, must have I felt of my own deficiency (if so proper a term 
I could have aspired to have been a Station Province.  

My only comfort I have had has [unreadable] for my Lord's sake 
Preserving since I came to this Station, my Afflictions & Trials 
have been heavy, very heavy indeed the very remembrance of them 
quite me. Yet blessed be God I have had some very precious 
season's of intercourse with God, & some of then have 
pleasant. A particular instance of this I will [end] July 1819. In this state I had at that Season of that 
Month had been from Saturday to Sunday Morning in burning 
Fever without remission, or one moment of ease from cracking Pains 
I was in every way supposed very low & hardly able to turn myself in 
Bed at this Pain, rendering it impossible to say. Still my poor Body was 
quite shrivelled with the burning heat. At this Juncture Satan made 
a most powerful attack upon me. & for in a short time his suggestions 
quite overpowered me, & I really thought I was going to Hell. 
at last I made an effort to lift my poor frame a little higher 
on the Pillows, & began to look to him who has said "Call upon me 
in the Day of trouble"; I did call, & blessed for ever blessed be his 
Holy Name, he heard, & while I was reflecting upon past manifesta- 
tions of his favour. Such a Flood of light & love broke in upon 
my poor Soul, that it almost overwhelmed me, I could as 
nothing else, burst of Praise. And let the world clotte it I shouted 
again if they please. Yet I know, I began to mend from that hour 
and still I keep God for a measure of the same Grace, & know he 
hear my prayers, and unworthy as I am or such [a] woman yet I have
not been here without [seeing some fruit.] of God, I truly feel the [force of the] 
apostles words "least who am indeed, left the least of all Saints in this race
