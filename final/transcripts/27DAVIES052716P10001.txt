the Inhabitants that the children are not learning any thing  
and it is their wish in general that Mr. First should attend  
the school, but I am sorry if he is obliged to leave the  
lodging as he said meeting every morning and evening the  

people & I like to go there once a week in general I had  
hopes that some good might be done among them I would  
say again if it is probable, I would pray for a helper  
if you can get any that will come in the name  

of Jesus. This every missionary must come here with his  
life in his hands, but God can spare our lives here, as well  
as at home & I have every prospect now. It said the  
climate may God make me useful I had some  

thing from Capt. Rowe, you'll see by his price that  
The Committee would save much money if they would  
embrace an opportunity £. or 3 times a year to send  
few necessary articles as we can not reasonably  

expect that no one will sell much under the market  
price in this place, and we must have the means  
of living; I assure you I try to live as saving as I can  
but you must see that it is otherwise I received from Captn.

Mr. Bickardike & Mrs. Butcher is going home with Capt. Rowe  
I will exceedingly oblige if you will have the goodness  
to ask Mr. Manchard to lend me by cabin house (as we  
expect to be here by Christmas) Mr. Delcarte purchased  

since I left. I have found no tickets  
either for stock or boards for my [unreadable]  
notes with some tickets have had no tickets  
since Octr. last. also some quires of class paper.  
The rainy season has commenced much earlier than  

Year than last. it is quite a considerable stay  
day to day. By looking over my accounts  
which I sent to Mr. Wood some time since  
I find that there is some error occasioned  

by my not receiving at that time some  
accounts between me & Mr. Nick of  
some goods received from him  
I'll correct the account in my  

Next quarter. I cannot as yet get  
any images or grogeries worth sending  
such things are not to be got easily without  
going to the country , please present my  

respects to the Committee, Mrs. B & Family  
I intend writing to our good friends Messrs.  
Fleming. I as Sir  
Yours truly William Davies
