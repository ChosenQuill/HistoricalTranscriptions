Surra Leone July 20th 1817

Dear Sir

We have frequently had it in contemplation to write you but our nonacquaintance and want 
of your address have prevented. You judge of our minds 
such restraints and given us the pleasing opportunity 
of unbosoming ourselves which we now embrace. Yours of 
personal letter of April 2nd came to hand on the 16th June 
and it afforded us no little pleasure as it informed us 
of a Preacher about to come over and help us, and of 
the blessed increase of Christ's kingdom in Cornwall; and 
what heightens our joy is the belief that of the increase of 
kingdom and Government there shall be no end. Sure 
it was for the effecting of these gracious purposes that 
God moved our good countrymen to raise subscriptions 
for Missionary support. May the Lord bless all who thus 
exert themselves with a present and eternal reward.

Permit us to tell you, dear sir, that it was the want 
of support, or at least, as we imagine, the uncertainty of it, which has been a cause of much pain and 
uneasiness to our minds, and has many times made 
us wish we had never come to Surra Leone. We knew 
indeed that the Doctor was obliged by a written agreement 
not only to support us so long as we remained here 
but also to see us well home if we lived and fulfilled 
the agreement on our part â€” yet we were receiving 
from the Missionary Committee which went beyond 
this agreement altogether, and we were apprehensive 
that the Doctor might at length come into their mea- 
sures. They demanded our immediate return to our 
country and trades unless we could support our- 
selves independent of any of our friends in England and 
show the uprightness of our conduct in the expenditure 
already incurred; while at the same time we had letters 
from the Doctor saying that if we returned home he 
would neither pay our passage nor honour our bills 
and putting us in mind of that agreement we had enter- 
ed into, not with the Missionary Committee, but himself. 
However we should not have failed to return home ac- 
cording to their peremptory command had it not been for 
such as the following reasons. 1st appeared to us there
