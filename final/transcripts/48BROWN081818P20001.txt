of the Spirit and power. Two Blk soldiers in addition  
to the others have within the last fortnight found peace through  
believing; in each of the added villages we have a little church  
of Christian believers, and the Lord is pleased to add to their  

number. I have introduced 3 persons as local preachers who  
are men of sound piety & minds, by their assistance we  
regularly attend and keep up our little country congregation.  
I labour under many discouragements, and the supercilious nature  

of the mission is not amongst the least, however so totally alike  
is the state of things here, that we cannot reduce the expenditure  
without hazarding our health &c. I am sorry that sickness  
has contributed so much to increase the expence, but it  

is what every European must reckon upon. I am hearty sorry  
for the Mission's sake and yours, that I am still alive,  
and possess of an unbroken constitution; as well as of  
the Spirit which delights to work in the Missionary field.  

I sent by British Tar a statement of accounts but  
as that vessel was lost they could not reach you. When I said  
I was glad that I am alive for the Mission's sake & yours  
I do not mean you are, or can be any personal gainer,  

but I remember the kindness you showed me in the vast  
expense attending my outfit - my support in Africa and  
my relief and comfort in sickness & privations.  
Pardon Rev Sir my freedom, and believe me your  
Affectionate & grateful Missionary Servant  

Samuel Brown  

NB. Please present my kind regards to Mrs Wood  
and if you would honour me with a line I shall  
be truly grateful. With kind regards to your colleagues.
