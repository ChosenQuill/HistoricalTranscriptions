If it has been pleaded, the People crying one upon another, & this has 
been the case in all the places. I have been to pray for 
ministry among us. the Lord has visited us the Poor 
God has begun the work & entrust His own, as I almost always 
do it is true the souls have been delivered while wrestling 

communicater the Testimony of my Fellow Labourers, though 
with God in private Prayer, & it has been generally marked by 
very clear & satisfactory evidences 
in Portuguese Town when we arrived there were about 19 in 

are about 58 People of that Town who meet in different Classes, 
& about the same attendance. I was enjoying. Glorious liberty 
I have lately visited a large Wattles Meeting, where the old are being 
in a numerous State, & told the People they must find their things 

to build the House & I would pay for building. One was there 
appointed a kind of Foreman of the business, and every Man both 
in & out of Society, brought his Post. Bundle of Wattles, & Bunch of 
Reefs, which we found enough. It reminded me of the gathering of the 
People at the erection of the Tabernacle. The House is beginning 
to hold all the People, & the Women are now busily engaged in 
muddying it inside. My little Desk is up. formed by cutting 2 
round Sticks in the ground, & nailing a piece of Board with 

top. The Governor has given me an Order for 2 dozen of Benches 
for the Judge, (the road to where Farm lays close by this Town) is 
not pleased with general behaviour of the People, & even having an 
adult School there, at which the Boys of his Farm attend. 

that he has given me £5. to assist us, so that here all our 
wants are supplied, and we have a good substantial house, 
I love the Discipline as well as Doctrine of Methodists and 
in endeavouring to enforce it I have found the good to result. 

that our Parish is thereby cleansed & enchained, and many confess 
are most astonishingly quickened, and if God be my Helper 
I will endeavour unweariedly to insure this course, 

to thank God how Cause looks well, & is growing. The Lord 
seems to have united my poor Talents to the work of leading 
this simple People to Christ, to arousing those who have already believed to 
the Holy Name for increasing the Glory. The growth of many of this 

People in divine grace has been astonishingly rapid indeed, & many 

of my dear young People would not doubt not astonish you by their

Fat neck Road, a place found since we came here within about 
14 months ago I formed a Class, there are now 3/4th of the present   

part of them that is earnestly brought to God. very many of them 
are Christians indeed, & some of my happiest Moments are when 

conversing with them. There is another precious work in their 
own People which is their great love they have for the Souls 

of their Country People, & many that were once 
in this they bear many insults. One poor Woman who 

was brought to rejoice in God a short time since to me 

a few days since. Oh Prince, my Prester-Emmanuel. K___ me.

His savaged the other much & she commenced a system others 

upon her, but she resisted not. Their affection is very 
great indeed. I think I may say of some of them as Paul 
said. they would pluck out their eyes to do me service 
and the leaders tell me their Prayers for me. As for the

soul is knit to them from what I have said it may be 
perhaps expected we should have a great increase of numbers 
but not so, for our reductions have been great. At Soldiers Town when 

we came we found there were 52 in Society on Lord. the next Quarter 
22 had removed to other settlements from the disbanding of the Regiment 
& 7 expelled.— at Congo Town where Bro. Devine went there first. he 
found the People (who prior to that time had been under the care of 
Coloured Man) talking much about Religion. he therefore took down 

the names of between 30 & 40 many of them he expelled before we 
came, so that 25 only remained, & in 2 Months afterwards were reduced

filled up by this increase. yet God knows my heart 
much for numbers, if they are to make up of those who

world in that Capacity 
Yet still I trust I shall quietly, submit
