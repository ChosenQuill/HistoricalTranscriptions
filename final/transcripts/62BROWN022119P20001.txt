we have many experimental believers in Christ.  
The good work proceeds and believers are added.  
It would do your heart good to see whom what God  
has done for them. A few weeks ago, at Bolders town  
while their meeting house was being rebuilt we held  

preached in a tent, I wished to excite them to get on with  
the Meeting House and observed. That a man or a woman  
who plastered a meeting House or carried stones to build  
We, did as honourable a worke for God, as an officer did  

for his King; when he sat upon an Horse and  
gave the word of command to the Soldiers might  
about face" They smiled and said "True." In three or  
four days after they, thatched & plastered & whitewashed  
it, put the legs in the forms, the door on the  
hinges & the desk in its proper place.  

I am coming home by Capt. Drone who gives me  
a passage and shall (if God will) have the  
gratification of seeing my friends and if the  
Committee think proper I must immediately proceed  
to West Indies or if they judged convenient to labour  
a little in England it would gratify me for  
the advantage.  

I have no intention of giving you a mere  
repetition of what I have said in my letter to the  
Committee and must conclude by subscribing  

myself Dear Sir your affectionate  
servant in the Lord
