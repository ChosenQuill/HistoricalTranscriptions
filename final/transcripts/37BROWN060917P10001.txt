2nd. Dr. Sir

As I have wrote two letters

to the Committee & have received none in

answer, I feel on such occasions (which has

remained till this latest opportunity) to write

again: and at the same time am not easy

to see to let this opportunity slip.

Our society appears to be a little more

united & the evils in part (which have arisen

from various causes) are removed. I begin to

have hope concerning this matter that it may

be in the end for the good of all concerned.

All our members being persons who are advanc-

ed towards the meridian of life or beyond it. I have

felt particularly anxious for the spiritual welfare

of young people and have opened a meeting

society Monday evening for them: when I

endeavour to impress on their minds the first

principal of the doctrine of Christ.

We have also opened two schools one at Portuguese

Town which consists of between 20 to 30 Scholars

principally Adults who appear very wishful

to learn. To these people we regularly preach twice

or three appear to have some conviction which

has impressed their conduct (God grant it may

end in their salvation) These we have put under

the care of an experienced Christian. They informed

appear in this place wishful to be taught and to

have their children brought up in the fear of God &

as they term it “in White man fashion.”
