Please till next dry season before we are both of us determined to
try if we cannot walk it thro that season.
These Rains are proving very sickly indeed, great numbers of 
Europeans have died since the Rains commenced, and many are
now sick. I have followed 2 of the Church Missionaries to their 
graves and am in hourly expectation of being called to the funeral 
of another who is given over by his attendants; one or two of them
in the Mountains are now dangerously ill and almost the whole
of them have already been sick, yet Glory be to God your 
poor unworthy Missionaries are at present both of them able to 
do their work and are ready to exclaim--why are we thus favored?
it is true we may one or both of us give these Rains, but we 
well know we shall not be called till our work is done, here 
are both of us happy in our work and notwithstanding we 
hear so frequently of the invalid death is making amongst the 
few whites who are here, yet we are satisfied we are in our 
place and that gives us comfort and strengthens our faith.

My worthy Colleague is just received from his seclusion after 
which this many had not been once
there was a mistake made in our numbers last Quarter 
they were not so many as reckoned. I have now sent an account in
them as returned from the Respective Papers both Quarters we have near
it agrees that the that the including the African Cap are lively
a rising Town is nearly scatterings yet the Lord has given us them 
in their Room, so that we are still on the increase, we have 
been obliged the immediately to cast off a few who were & had been 
trusters to the Church and we praise God we are not declining the People 
are growing in grace. March 1819

The ready Money which has been remitt’d has been kindly 
advanced to me as I did not like that we should draw a bill 
till we were compelled, but keep it off as long as possible, and rejoice 
that it should not get home before this Quarter’s accounts 
beg. Vessel by which this goes is the only one since our 
Quarter that’s yet [unreadable]. I do not expect she will reach home 
for 3 months, as she is going back to the Gambia to take 
part of her Cargo, a run sometimes of 20 days, the last 
a short distance in consequence of having to beat all the 
way against the trade wind. 
Another Vessel has arrived since writing my last and not a 
letter for either of us, which not a little disappoints us 
especially when we see in the Letters of others, Missionary Notices 
of 2 Months later date than we have received 
as mentioned in a former letter our intention to petition the Governor 
and Council for a waste plot of Land between our premises & the 
street, and so few any since I wrote on his Excellency the 
Governor who received me very politely and promised to give 
his support to the Petition when presented before the Board, 
and that, not only for the Waste Spot but also to issue a 
grant for the ground on which the Congo Chapel stands which 
has not yet been obtained, together with a sufficient quantity 
of Land for a Mission House in that Town where many 
of them live. And he also promised to support our 
petition for a point of Land at the west end where 
the Lord has been & still is working so graciously, a lot 
having lately fallen into the hands of the King they want 
it there. This Lot, should we obtain it, will be of great 
value, as in a few years it will be almost in the 
Center of this large Town, now to the Town receiving all 
its enlargement at this end, as indeed at the other there 
have no convenience for enlargement. Here we can tho’ 
first house have a settled one which would be better 
for us than at present, as we are now in another Man’s 
yard and a very wet one, & he could remove the same 
house to that Lot. Hoping we are not forgotten by your 
kind have an interest in your fervent Prayers I remain 
dear Brother yours very respectfully 
Baker

P.S. The Missionary mentioned in the former 
part of this letter is just dead, an account of which I have 
this instant received, and I have heard of several more 
yesterday. I fear that we are even very ill, very few 
Europeans remain, one gentleman in the delirium of fever 
cut his throat twice — every there now wears a very gloomy 
appearance. The only safety is in being prepared to die. 
Glory be to God I believe not only for myself but my Colleague 
I can say feelingly “Father thy will be done”
