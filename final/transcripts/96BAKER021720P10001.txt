Revd dear Father

Sierra Leone Febry 17. 1820

I know not the time you  
intend sending me the help Mr Taylor speaks of  
in his letter of Oct 29th but should they not arrive  
till next month it would be too late for us to  

make any alteration till the Rains are past, as they  
would then be on the eve of commencing & should  
even Mr Talboys come here, his being at the Wesh  
Indies many years will not season him here, as,  

People coming here from thence & the most unshel-  
-tered parts of the coast have stood on exactly the same  
footing as others, indeed many from the West  
Indies died last year. His escaping therefore would  

not depend on that; and against those destined for  
the Gambia if they went would arrive just as the  
Rains commenced (& granting they could procure a passage  
immediately on their arrival, which is very uncertain)  

and as there are no Houses to procure lodgings ab  
there we should have to face the Rains in some  
wretched huts which if I should providently escape, my  
Colleague humanely speaking would be sure to assist  

to stand it. I hope my dear Father will excuse the  
liberty I now take on the subject. That letter contains  
which many throw a little more light on them  
In reference to the Gambia, you will perceive by  

my letter 1. 2. 3 written before I received yours, that I  
shall hail this auspicious event. I do indeed look ab  
it as one that promises much good. The River  
itself is such an inlet to the interior of Africa &  

extend so far, as will enable Missionaries to enter  
the very heart of the Country and plant the Stand  
ard of the Cross amidst the delusions of Mahomedan  
ism and the folly & superstition of Paganism; and what  

there is of merchandize, that we may end & spread sure  
to find the interior healthier than at the mouth of the  
River. The banks of this mighty stream are inhabited  
principally by 2 Classes of People. The Jaloofs Jaloof  
Foulahs & Mandingoes. The general Religion of the  

whole is Mahomedanism, tho the great bulk of the  
People retain their Pagan superstitions  

The Jaloofs are very revengeful never forgiving an  
injury, yet at the same time they are very affectionate  
& grateful to their Benefactors. The Jaloofs all are a  
warlike active People very much attached to Mohame
