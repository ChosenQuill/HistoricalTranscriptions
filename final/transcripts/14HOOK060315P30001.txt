blessings presented a beautiful specimen of what this 
part of Africa might be brought to, did the the poor 
ignorant natives know how to improve those blessings 
which Providence has bestowed on them. Tobacco might 
undoubtedly be made an Article of the first importance for 

exportations, if they only knew how to Manufacture it by their 
having proper Instruments and instruction on this subject. 
Europeans might at no great distance be rendered independ- 
ant of America, for Tobacco and Rice. By the great encou-

I am afraid I have quite exhausted your patience in de- 
parting from the subject of my Letter to which be sure 
to conclude. Beg leave again to call your on behalf of 
this benighted place, in endeavoring to get a Missionary 
or Chaplain and Schoolmaster sent out as soon as 

possible. I can assure you that the Inhabitants would 
contribute liberally towards paying the Schoolmaster, 
and he will meet with every assistance from the Europeans 
in other respects. I should be happy to give you any in- 

formation you may wish respecting this part of 
Africa. Letters left at Mr. Cluer's 3 Skinner Street Smithfield, 
or Messrs Silver's 28 Hatton Garden, will be regularly 
forwarded to me, but I hope to be in London about 

September next, and shall be glad to give you every 
intelligence respecting Senegal and Goree, and other 
particulars, which my experience here, and knowledge 
of the native Language, may enable me to give 

I am Sir, with great respect, 
Your most obed. & obt. Servt. 
J. J. Hook.
