lately the Lord has been reviving 
his work in the society again. The 
two or three last sermons I preached 
before my late sickness, the Lord was pleased 
to bless to many souls. Oh for more strength 
to preach his word! I bless God I can say truly 
with [fervent] life to spend, in publishing the 
sinner's friend. He is my all and in all, 
in all my rest, my success. When I 
came here first and for some time 
after I was almost in despair in reference to 
the work of God among the Society in [town] and 
this I feared would be our hindrance to the further 
spread of divine truth; but my dear colleagues 
and myself laid it down as a Rule from the 
first, never to flinch from any point of disci- 
pline or suffer those, in any place whom we 
meant to feel were deceiving themselves to go to 
hell quietly. This made us use the plainest 
and most faithful dealing we could with such 
characters, and now thank God the incorrigible 
have been all as we trust nearly all dismissed. 
The [flock] here for some time has 
been growing in grace, and now it 
gives me to see how the word of God, and 
of room to accommodate them. I am certain our 
Chapel, the much the largest in town is not half 
large enough to contain the people who wish to attend. 
The place is quite crammed to suffocation. 
I am obliged as soon as I get home 
[to] change every thing I have on even my coat, 
and it pains me because it is like shutting those 
mouths whatsoever opened to receive the bread of life. 
I do hope you have long ere this received my 
Letter of June sent by the way of Liverpool, and 
taken the case of our Chapel into consideration and 
consented to help us. I can truly say our prospects 
are bounded in town by one very small Chapel. 

I received safely the Packet containing the address 
of the Conference to the societies, at the reading of which 
I felt both gratified and humbled, and earnestly pray 
that every step taken may be crowned with full success. 
I have also received your Circular to the Missionaries.

for which I am thankful as it contains much 
useful information and advice in reference to 
what is said of the peculiar temptations of Mission- 
aries, I am sure all who sustain that important 

office must feel the force of it: especially to young Men 
And that remark of Vice being left secret and thought 
less shameful than at home, particularly applies 
among untutor'd Africans. I thank God I feel the 

force of the whole remark as particularly applying 
to the Station in which I labour, where Vices of 
this description are common; and I am sorry to say 
the Whites, here in general are forward in the commis- 

sion of Vice notwithstanding the dangers which sur- 
round them. I have set my face fully against 
any of our People living in a state of Concubinage 
I wrote you some time ago of our having 

met a Class at the West end of Free Town 
which thank God is now one of our most 
promising societies. After they had been on 
a state I told them, they must all get married if 

wished to remain with us. They were quite 
willing and I took down the Names of the People 
and that about 3 of the Men & the Women with 
them to the Governor (which by the bye will 

now greatly please him as he has desired me to 
see all the People Married and baptized off [freedom?] 
Two or three of the Women had improperly Men 
to whom brought themselves I suppose you no many may 

as I leave you, this time. I want to seek good 
live Christian fashion, they have consented. 
These things are pleasing and to me very en- 

couraging I hope my dear Brethren have taken 
my request of two Missionaries into consideration 
I am more & more convinced up to my own satisfaction 
of what I have there said 

in reference to Long Town as they are so far from 
us, we can seldom or ever see them after the Rain 
begin even tho we seek our health and if one 

were stationed there he would find plenty of 
employment, and this would be making 
a Step towards those who are at present 
very far from us 

Yours 

Baker
