rented the house to one [unreadable] & I fear that I shall have  
some trouble to get him out of it. The situation of the house I  
like very well, but it is rather too far from the Chapel, in  
the rainy season. If it be thought advisable to sell it  
we have full authority from Dr. [unreadable] heirs or Executor as it  
stands in his name. In that case the money might be  
applied to building a more convenient house on a plot that  
they have by the side of the Chaple - We live at present with  
Mr. Nicols the Mayor of the town, who views us with great kindness  
every thing here is uncommonly dear; 6 Dollars for making a Coat 2 1/2 for  
a pair of Shoes & we must pay 6£ per Month for a small house,  
until we can get into one our own. But I feel very happy at  
present & if the Lord spare my life & grant my partner her  
health, I hope we shall be made useful to many souls. There  
are many perishing for lack of knowledge in this town and  
its vicinity. There be several Towns within a few Miles of this city  
which I intend to visit if the Lord grant me health. Certainly  
the harvest is great & the laborers few; yet, men of God are sent who  
have power over sin, and are endeavoring to bring the people to God  
by teaching them the way to the Kingdom under scriptural discipline.  
Of late I have seen the value of our Doctrinal Disciplines more than ever.  

Surely these people shall be my people and their God my God.  
It does my heart good, while writing this letter to think on the zeal  
& faithfulness of our friends at home in exerting themselves to  
print Missionary Meetings, Go on in the name of the Lord "yet there  
is room", you are highly blessed indeed with Gospel privileges.  

At home, I need not ask you to remember us before the Throne  
of Grace as I believe you do, & it gives me pleasure to think of the  
thousands of Prayers offered up for our safety - Y[unreadable] in the bonds of Christian love

Copy of a letter from Mr. Leigh to the rec. dated New-Madeira, March 30th, 18[unreadable]  
Dear Brethren  
On Tuesday Feb. 20th we sailed from St. Helens  
the wind continuing fair for some time, we soon left our native  
country, but not without natural feeling; our last looks  
on those happy shores, was joined with the ancient desire  
that God's blessing might rest on all that we had left behind.  
Monday Even. Mar. 9th we were separated from convoy by a gale  
of Wind. Tuesday at day break saw 2 large vessels which  
appearing to be American Brigs, all hands were called upon  
Deck to prepare for Action, but soon the Cabin echoed with  
"all is well". The Captain judged them to be Spanish Ships  
Tuesday Even. 17th we were driven into the Bay of Biscay by a storm  
which continued more or less till the 19th. The Captain said  
he had not experienced such a storm before during 30 years  
he had been at sea; several times he thought of throwing  
the Guns aboard. When it subsided, all seemed thankful  
to God for preserving us from a watery grave & from any accident  
for not so much [unreadable] as a rope failed in all the tempest, neither  
have we sustained any loss since we left England except one horse

While the storm lasted I was sick but thank God am now  
recovered and enjoy a good state of health. With respect to my situa-  
tion it is much better than I expected to find, it and even on Board  
a Ship I can say, "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places."  
A day or two after I came on board, the Captain came into my Cabin  
and requested me to bless him by asking a blessing & returning thanks  
at our meals, & read prayers & preach to them on the Sundays. I fas-  
red him it would afford me great pleasure to do so, & accepted his  
kind invitation. A few days after he expressed a desire to have the  
children on board instructed in reading, & lest feared he would be asking  
too much, for me to attend to them. I assured him it would  
give me the greatest pleasure to render myself useful either to the  
children or any on board. He then put them under my care.  
My present course of action is nearly as follows: 1st. Always to be at Table  
in time to say Grace 2. Attend to the Children. Every Morning at 10  
I read the Lessons & Prayers for the day, beginning & concluding with Prayer.  
On Sundays read the Church Prayers & Preach when circumstances  
will admit. The third part of the day I hear the Children read &  
answer such questions as I propound to them, & I can assure  
you I have experienced many blessings in this labor of love—I could  
not help weeping for joy after the Captain left my Cabin when I found  
that his requests were nearly such as I had made memorandum  
of; for to ask them. I have likewise under instruction, a young  
Man who is going with his parents to settle in N. S. W. He attends  
to the Latin & English during the Morning & in the Evening  
I give him a Lesson in Geography in my Cabin & conclude  
with prayer. This way of proceeding has already gained the approba-  
tion of the passengers & I am only in danger of being lifted up with  
pride. May the Lord keep me humble. Since I left London I have  
been much exercised about N. S. W. Mission, but when numerous diffi-  
culties have appeared before me I have continued a voice saying "Go on  
the Lord is with thee, thy God will protect thee." May the Lord turn the  
hearts of his people that his Misssearies may go forth proclaiming  
salvation to all the world. With respect to myself I am constrained  
to say "goodness & mercy have followed me all the days of my life"  
Although I shall not forget it especially after the stretch I have  
experienced since I left you. I know the Lord is my portion &  
while I look to him I shall not want. Dear Brethren pray for  
me that my faith fail not & that I may be useful on the  
wing of your faith & prayers to my wished for station Sidney.  

My dear Bror.  
I remain your Son in the Gospel  
London May 19th, 1819. I suffer  
to transcribe the above Letters, which I have  
received since, & had the pleasure of seeing you  
with which I have no doubt but you will be  
gratified. I need not say how much I was dis-  
appointed in not hearing any part of your speech  
in your presence from Bristol—Mr. K. is of  
the same opinion with myself we cannot do other  
as abstract of it. Do not fail to send it in the course  
of a few days—I have no doubt but you will indeed it.
