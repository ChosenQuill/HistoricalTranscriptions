The watted School House for females which would from its  
proximity to our House be under our eye at all times seasons  
of the Year and would be of great advantage indeed as we  
could visit this School often, and at times when the weather  
would not permit us were it at a distance; of this School  
we hope shortly to send you some account. As it respects this  

work of God, thanks to his Name he is still carrying it on   
we have baptized several lately who gave satisfactory proofs  
that Christ was the object of their search. At our Quarter  
Meeting April 1st Peace and Unanimity prevailed among us  
we found our Numbers in Society were 2 hundred, and 50  

on trial. Thank God we hope he will abundantly carry on  
his good work till the whole of this Wilderness shall bud  
and blossom as the Rose. The Devil is also stirring and as  
usual is endeavoring to make slander the cause of separating  

the People of God. But hitherto he hath failed. A circumstance  
took place a short time since which displayed the Victory of  
Christ over the Enemy. I went on a Sunday to preach at Free  
Town, and as is my custom I went round to invite the People  

to preaching; when I to three of the People who for their immorality  
had been some time before excluded from meeting in Class came  
to me and began to lay a heavy charge against the Man  
who is Leader of the Male Class in conjunction with the Pre-  

saying he had been fighting with a These man. I said,  
unless arose I settill this Palaver. When I had preached  
led a Class of 19 Hours (for I had told them they must  
I then called them together into the House of one of the Base  

and many others came. I began by saying that before I mention  
the Charge I would observe that I did not nor should not believe  
the Report unless they could bring evidence of the fact, I should  
not take their bare assertion. I then stated the Charge at which  
the Poor Man seemed quite surprised as he knew nothing of this  

and desired the accuser to produce any Person who had seen  
him fighting. They could now only produce one Woman who  
they said was present; the Woman was called and when she  
came forward. She said it was true that she came home  

from Free Town with the Leader, at the very time they  
charged him with having fought with another Man, but she  
never saw any thing of the kind. Upon this they appeared  
quite confused, and I endeavoured to impress upon their minds  

the great sin they committed in thus presenting the people of  
God, two of them seemed ashamed of their conduct. I mention this  
to show that here the Devil uses the same means as in Europe  
And surely as it respects ourselves we are placed in the midst of many  

and great dangers, An European who has never visited climates  
like these can form no Idea of the nature and variety of the  
snares to which from the nature of the Climate and the manners  
of the people we are exposed. We hope our dear Father will  
pray much for us. As one of the greatest favours you can bestow  

upon us let us live in your Prayers, tho the dangers of the cl-  
mate as it respects the Body are very great, they are nothing when  
compared with those of the Soul, and I frequently am 
of these temptations I could take myself which seem as if  
as, makes the Soul shrink back and tremble, lest its weakness  
should occasion it to slide, into the wide extended Whirlpools  
Which when once the Circu, such is the force of its continuance  

Poisoning Stream, it scarcely we can hope, these flattering  
twigs; Time to come, Time plenty yet remaining, which  
as Temptations, lay on the edge of this wide Whirlpool, they fix  
the soul to think, Time plenty yet remains on hand to save  
from Ruin; And should Boldness rise within, and fondly  

call, the Soul now weakened in its desires for God & heaven, tho  
it lays hold of Time yet present, to seek God. Yet like the  
Israelitish Champion shorn of its strength. the hold is often  
feeble, so much so, that, while it thinks Salvation sure, it lose  
this feeble grasp, and sinks to rise no more.  

yet we are to trust notwithstanding all this, our heavenly Father  
will keep us to the end, the only trust in the promised assistance  
of his grace to be enabled to continue to hold fast; and hope the Lord  
will help us by the constant exercise of Prayer and watchfulness to hold  

up the flame of Piety within. Without this we know and know  
cannot expect that much success can attend our la-  
April 14th We have just began preaching at the West End of the  
Town in a very small hut belonging to one of our Members  
wich will not hold above 10 People, but many stand outside  

can. In this part of the Town they are generally Portuguese  
so called so from their coming from Portuguese settlement  
slaves taken from that People, the Lord has already began  
work among them, and last night I went there to preach  

and after I had finished I complied with the earnest request of  
those poor creatures and formed them into a Class. There are about  
8 of them the whole of which I questioned first generally by asking  
them, well People you hear me talk this time, i.e. have you  

understood what I have said, they all answered, O yes Massa, we  
hear you well this time. I then asked all those who were anxious  
to meet in Class, what made them wish to do so, they severally  
answered, We feel we poor Sinners my heart be trouble me  
much, I want for find God, and did what they said was perfectly  

satisfactory. As these People live all together at the opposite end  
of the Town from our Chapel and half a mile distant I intend  
building a thatched meeting house just in the middle of them  
it is not here as in England, where people can reason on the  

necessity of hearing God's Word, these People knows no necessity and  
therefore we must carry the Gospel to them. I suppose there are between  
3 and 4 hundred Persons who lives as it were all in Christo which  
would very many of them come to hear god's word. who now go no  
whore, this, we have had proof of in one little but; Under these  

considerations, I hope dear Father, you will not blame me  
should I draw 7 or 8 Pounds towards the erection of a place  
just such as in England our Open are kept in, to telt gud  
Palaver (as the people here call it). You may answer but Mr Browne  

has lately built one or two without any help from us - by begging  
for it they. I mean to raise what I can in this way, but Mr  
Browne had an opportunity of using money that was collected  
to Free Town Chapel, the state of which Chapel and the  
necessity of a new >
