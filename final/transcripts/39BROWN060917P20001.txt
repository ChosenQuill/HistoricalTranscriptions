and last Sunday Morning I Baptized 15 of their  
Children when about 60 or 70 adults were present  
in our little wattle meeting house which  
we have in this village.  
 
The other school is at the west end of the Town  
near our house and consists of upward of 40 Girls  
which Mrs. Brown teaches sewing & reading  
We open school with singing & prayer & conclude in  
the evening with the same exercises. We have  
no assistance except from a Boy whom I got from  
the Hospital about 7 months back. He knew the  
alphabet and can now read a Chapter in the  
Testament. Is a modest boy, he being serious  
and steady & eager to improve himself & attentive  
to his charge.  

The above engagements together with Preaching Visit  
the sick &c keep me in full employ and are  
more than I can do to the edification of the people  
& my own credit. This will be evident when you consider  
my situation being stationary & having many defects & wants  
a full view of these things will lead the Committee to  
see I am persuaded the necessity of sending a preacher  
to take Mr. Grovier’s place as superintendent of the Mission  
here; as there is the likelihood of him resuming his  
work to the comfort & well-being of the parties  
(however this is my opinion).  

I am thankful that we enjoy our health  
and have (through) passed through the seasoning  
sickness. I’d like to live that I may be an  
instrument of good to the Mission. I am often  
discouraged on account of my being apprehensively  
a useless missionary. I can say with the greatest

evil that I can contemplate is to spend my days  
as a dead weight in the skirts of the church of  
God.]  

Dr Sir Please to write me, and present our  
kind regards to Mrs. Wood, Miss Wood & family  
and if you have an occasion to go to St George's  
will be much obliged if you will present my  

kind regards to Mrs. Captain Rowe & the Rev  
I have got a letter, directed for Captain Rowe whom  
I am afraid I cannot forward to him in time  
want of conveyance. & an opportunity shall offer  

the course of 5 or 6 weeks I will put them under  
and send them back.  

Dr Sir you will please excuse  
my errors and accept in part  

as an apology for my sending  
Know this blotched  
Epistle my want of time  
to correct it and  

Believe me your  
obedient servant  
in the Gospel
