They are all recaptured Negroes and are  
in general married. From an earnest  
desire to have their Children taught to read  
and that they might have an opportunity  

of hearing the Gospel preached they commenced  
a subscription amongst themselves  
to build a Chapel, and laid its foundations  
which by the labours of husbands and children has been

nearly raised, to serve the double purpose  
of a school and a Chapel. Here I have three  
who profess to enjoy peace with God and  

twenty four who are on trial under the  
different degrees of concern for Salvation.  
We have appointed Moses Brown, a  
recaptured Negro whom I have taught to  

read & write, as School Master under the  
immediate care of the Brethren. We are fully  
satisfied as to his suitableness for the work. He  
lived with me two years and on the whole  

behaved himself so as to give satisfaction.  
Not only do the children want instruction  
but also the adults, and it gave me great  
pleasure to see the progress which several  

made from receiving only lessons each week  
which was all that my engagements would  
admit of. The congregation is usually from 40  
to 80 and the prospects are very pleasing.  

Soldiers Town is the first  
of our country villages for the importance of the  
fruits it has yielded to our Mission. It has  
received its name from it being the usual

I commenced my labours in it and took my  
stand in the open air, on an elevated  
place and assisted by some of our members  
from Free Town began the service. At  

first about twenty attended chiefly females  
afterwards the number to 50 or 60. I  
continued my out door Preaching 14 weeks when  
on July 6th I opened a wattled meeting house  

which had cost us about ten pounds and  
would accommodate an hundred and fifty  
hearers. I now by the assistance of some of the  
leaders visited them three times each week  

twice on Sunday and on Thursday evening.  
The Congregation was usually from 50 to 100  
about two thirds women and were very  
attentive. Some became impressed by the  

truths which they heard and shewed by a  
reformation in their lives, the necessity of  
their improvement of character. I collected  
and formed two classes and others were joined  

to some of the classes in Free Town. The concern  
of many wore away but their places were  
more than filled up by the addition of others.  
I found it  

very difficult at first to make myself  
understood and was obliged to accommodate  
myself to their capacities and knowledge  
of the English language. The state in which
