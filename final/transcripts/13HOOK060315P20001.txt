gospel, into the most remote regions of this al-  
most unknown Country. But the purport of this  
is to excite your interest in our behalf in using  
your endeavours to procure us an Intelligent  
Missionary and Schoolmaster. Sometime ago  
wrote my Friend the Revd. Mr. Grey, of Crown Court,  
on the same subject, but have not yet received  
an answer, and as it is of the utmost importance  
that immediate steps be taken to cultivate  
the minds of the youth in Senegal, I have  
taken the liberty of earnestly beseeching you  
to use your influence, in doing something  
for this hitherto neglected Settlement. In  
my opinion nothing can be so productive of  
good in this Country as Schoolmasters, and  
some steady Artificers, to impart to the youth  
a knowledge of Mechanics and the blessings  
of a civilized state. Art and Science naturally  
tend to cultivate the rude ideas of the mind and  
to stimulate it to enquiries of a more sublime  
nature. Little, very little good can be done among  
the aged here, in the ways of religion, it is to the  
rising generation that our chief attention should  
be directed, from them we may expect every  
thing which human nature is capable of  
receiving and imparting, but the aged are in  
general rigid Mahometans, whose delusive  
Religion reigns here, in its full Meridian  
splendour. A Missionary or Schoolmaster  
coming here, might depend on every assistance  
from our worthy Lt. Governor, who has often  
assured me that he would do anything in  
his power to assist, either a Missionary or  
Schoolmaster, but they should be both emer-

sent in the French Language, as it is much  
or rather generally spoken in Senegal. I  
cannot help lamenting that the place should  
be so little known in England, its importance  
as to situation and trade infinitely exceeds every  

other Colony between here, and the Cape of Good Hope,  
and I sincerely trust, that Government may keep  
it in our possession, which will be the only means  
of completely abolishing the horrid traffic in  
our fellow Creatures, In this part of Africa, but for  

the presence of a few interested Frenchmen,  
Slavery would soon be forgotten in Senegal and  
honorable Commerce, which already begins  
to rear its interesting form, & pursued with  
alacrity and interest. Ever since came to this  

Country, two and a half years ago, I have wished  
to see something of its Interior, and about a month  
ago I embarked in my Boat for Doni√©, a place  
upwards of two hundred miles up the Senegal  
(and of course one East, from this place) where I  

have a depot trading for gum. It would be pre-  
sumptive in me, and foreign to my subject to  
begin, and give you a detailed account of this part  
of the River Senegal, whose banks abound with  
large Villages and Towns, but I cannot help  

remarking that after I had sailed about ninety  
or a hundred miles, the Banks of this fine River,  
presented a most interesting scene to the eye of an  
Englishman. On the right Bank of the River,  
bordering on the great Desart Zara, there quality  

is of a rich sandy soil, and well calculated to pro-  
duce Rice, Tobacco and Cotton, but the left Banks  
were covered with Fields of Corn & Tobacco, with quan-  
tities of European Melons, &c. The Tobacco was in
