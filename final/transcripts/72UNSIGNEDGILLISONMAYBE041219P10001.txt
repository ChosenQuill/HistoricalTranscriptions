San Leone April 18th 1849

Rev'd and dear Father,

I embrace the present op-  
portunity of addressing you as I expect it will be the last  
this side of the commencement of the rains, and hearing  
from persons in this place during that season is very  
uncertain. I am happy to say we are at present both of  
us free from sickness, tho very weak from what little we  
have had. Since my last to you I have had what is here  
called a very slight attack of fever. On the 8th I had been  
engaged all the morning in the till about 2 o'clock I then  
went into the house and had not been in 5 minutes  
before I was taken sick, altho I had not the fever above  
4 or 5 times yet its violence was such that it has left me  
very weak indeed and this weakness still continues. B. Gillam  
has not had the fever but has suffered much from loss  
of it at present not very strong. But we hope this will  
my respect be for our good. As it respects our health in  
at the present sickness there is no unfavourable token, as  
people who have slight attacks at their first coming out  
really go better when the fever becomes more severe. And  
it respects our souls, here I trust it will be of great good  
as it teaches us the necessity of living in a prepared state  
to die. Thank God when I felt the fever's burning rage  
& the dreadful thirst which accompanied it, yet in that  
hour I felt sweet peace and an overflowing sense of the divine  
presence, and could feelingly say "Father thy will be done." We  
have nearly got everything ready for our School at Congo Town  
(where as I mentioned in my last we have a Chapel building)  
which we intend keeping in our own hut till the Chapel is  
finished. Here we mean to reside alternately 2 or 3 days a week  
as we wish to pay as much attention to this School as we can  
We intend going over to Bonow to take away the Mamoro's of  
the Children and make a beginning. The 50Â£ per annum  
which you gave us leave to draw for female schools - has been (for  
the first year) applied by Mr Brown (as he will inform you)  
towards the erection of the Chapel at Congo Town as that will  
be the school house. But it is my intention to send in a  
petition to the Governor to grant us a waste spot of land  
which lays between our garden fence and the street which  
if we obtain as I doubt not but we shall) it will be of  
great service to us in 3 respects. 1st It will bring our premises  
forward to the street and thus prevent any dey from getting  
this waste spot and building houses in those station which  
would be greatly to the disadvantage of our premises which is now  
increasing in value every [year]. 2nd Husoon we can erect a
