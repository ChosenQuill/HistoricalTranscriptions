Extract of a letter from Mr. Brown dated Sierra Leone 44

Sierra Leone February 21st 1819

Rev & Dear Sir,

I have wrote by this opportunity to Mr. Bunting and stated at some length various things relative to this Mission. The object of this is merely to convey to you a statement of its financial concerns. As I before intimated I found it absolutely necessary

to purchase our Horse, indeed had I done justice to myself I should have purchased it twelve months as the labour of the Circuit (so I may now stile it) was more than one comes do and walk in justice to his health and life. The Painting, whitewashing the old meeting House, the

fitting up a square seat or pew, which surrounds the pul- The covering it with green baize and the putting out of in Mourning for the Queen will cost us about £9. But we think we have acted prudently & perhaps thriftily, in attemp-

to seat for our European Brethren, who seem disposed to attend By this means we get away to their pockets at our monthly collections and I hope God will give us a way to their hearts by his blessed word.

In the Congo Town (or village) we are building a stone Chapel outside 30 by 20. The inhabitants who are all recaptured Negroes do some work and have subscribed about £20. In this place we intend keeping services to

to read. I have heard the children lessons every Friday afternoon for some time back. I suppose I rather under than overrate the Adults at 350 & the Children at 50 or 60 visitors besides

additional built of the Chapel. I am persuaded that this 

is a field which promises much good nor does it interfere with the labours of any other missionary.

The wattle Meeting Houses formerly built at W[unreadable] and Solomon's Cove have fallen into ruins and are now elevated, Thank to God at each of these places
