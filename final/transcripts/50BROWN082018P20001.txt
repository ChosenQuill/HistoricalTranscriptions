Rested & grounded. Englishmen have prejudices, and 
Churchmen may have jealousies. Which would more 
sensibly operate against the thousand plan, than 
if it were fully established, and matured, by [unreadable] 

Missionaries. The force of this remark may appear to the 
Committee when they are informed that the population of the 
country villages, consists of recaptured people, who are tutored 
by Government superintendents, and taught religion, by Church 
Missionaries, or Schoolmasters &c. I am lead to think, the

meant of introduction into the Ministry, (I mean the subordinates)
in the West Indies, are not as enlightened, and have as
in England. We are surrounded with fallen Preachers of colour,
who have received assistance and encouragement from different

religious societies at home, and the present Preachers of Colour
are nearly as full of their own wisdom as they can be made
if you converse with them, they will occupy four fifths of the
time, and act of themselves, as your instructors. This is

absolutely necessary that the second Missionary should have
clear, and extended views, of our Intention & discipline; that
he might assist your present Missionary, and in case of his
sickness, death, or removal, be safely intrusted with the management

of the Society. The Committee have not learned to judge correctly
in thinking this climate most favourable to West Indians
than Europeans. It has been found equally (if not more) fatal
to the former than to the latter. Young Missionary is very

uneasy in his present situation; and anxious to be connected
with persons, of the purity of whose statements, motives, routine
the Committee can entertain no doubt. He owes his all to
Methodism - is by choice a Methodist Missionary and trusts, that he

is not sacrificing to the lust of the flesh; but striving to
walk according to God in the spirit; that he may be
approved as a faithfull steward of the grace of God.
He is not weary, nor ashamed of his work and Connections;

but accounts the preaching of the C[?] his happiness and
Glory: nor does he repent becoming a Missionary, though
he has seen various and complicated afflictions at
the hands of the Lord. He hopes that his love to the cause

is superior to every personal consideration, of affluence or 
honour; if the latter had been his object he must have pursued
and adopted a different course to what he has done; to 
approve himself as a pious and useful Missionary [unreadable] 
to the Committee, and his God, is the highest object of his 
ambition on earth. 

I am sorry that my indisposition prevented my 
giving the Members their last Quarter's Tickets till a few 

days back; however I found many of the people advanced
in love to one another, and to their adorable Saviour. We 
had a good deal happy in the love of Jesus. Joseph Brown 
who for upwards of 30 years was a peaceable, steady, 

pious & industrious leader & local Preacher, while many others 
were puffed up in their vain minds, and fell into the snares 
of the devil, by divine grace he stood, bore the heat [unreadable] 
of the day. He paid two visits to England, and was first 

respected and highly respected by the late Rev. Mr Jonathan 
Rankin. In a letter sent by the latter, is his honest 
“testimony” Brother Brown’s piety and sincerity had warmed 
him to his friends in London, and to me in a particular 

manner; and I am happy that I have been able to serve 
him in any little matter. This servant of God grown old 
in the service of his Master, gradually sunk under the pressure 
of infirmities, and years; and on May 31st 1818 his holy 

spirit entered the paradise of God. On the following morning 
I improved the circumstance, to a crowded & well disposed Congregation 
and then committed his body to the grave till the great 
resurrection. I have introduced 3 young men at Inglis’ Branch 

who appear to have sound piety & mind. With their assistance 
regularly supply our Congregations at Soldiers & Pontagues times 
at each we have a little Church of steam believers. 4 of the late 
soldiers, are now converted, unit look as becomes the Gospel.

Our number will be about the same as last Quarter 150 Members. 
Pardon my freedom and believe me your 
Affectionate and Grateful 
Servant Samuel Brown
