29. Extract of a Letter from Sierra Leone 29th May 1828

I embrace the opportunity by our friend Capt Howe, to
write to you, through many enjoy my health well at
present and feel a desire to spend & be spent in the service of Christ
About a week ago, one of our [unreadable] died happy in God

I went to see him a day before his departure. I asked him
if he found Christ precious to his soul, he said if it was
not for that he did not know what would have become of
him in his illness of six months. I have not done much

for him, but He hath done all for me. I venture my
soul upon his merits. I have nothing particular to inform
you of. We are going on much the same, I am sorry that
as I am alone that I cannot attend much to the country.

There is one of the Church Missionaries removed from
the country to Aintree in this neighborhood which
I have visited occasionally. I think that most of
them will come by by into this neighborhood if I

had Missionaries I might have had many important stations
in this place, but the school & the meeting house takes
up most of my time, I have now about 160 children,
I gave up 190 to the Leicester mountain settlement.

As I had more than I could manage, the children
are improving gradually & I hope to see some good
done among them. I understood last night from Mr Beckford
that they are going to have one of the Church Missionary school

Masters, the good will come under the care of God & Providence.
