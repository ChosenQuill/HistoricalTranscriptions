My Dear Sir,

Last night I received your letters, by the favour of Mr. Sheffey, who with his wife arrived 
in safely in this colony about 12 oâ€™clock at noon. I was truly glad to hear from my native 
land; particularly to hear that the kingdom of Jesus is in an indispensable state home & abroad. 
The language of my soul is, "Thy kingdom come, more and more into my soul, and into the souls

of all thy servants, who are thy chosen instruments, to convey thy heavenly treasure, even the 
word of reconciliation, that it may be wafted into the remotest parts of the inhabited globe, 
that the wilderness and solitary places may be glad, & the desert rejoice and blossom as the rose.
I feel truly sensible of my unworthiness for the accomplishment of this work. My work of preaching

among the heathens, the unsearchable riches of Christ; but yet feel truly happy, when I con-

sider that my sufficiency is of God. I am determined to devote myself to the service more and more. 
Fill me with that holy love which is stronger than death. My flesh
and myself are just recovering from a fever. Mr. Kiest had a very severe attack; 
his pulse at one time was as high as 125 per minute; but he who orders all things for our

and a daughter; the mother was a backslider; the mother died about a month ago, the 
daughter last Sunday night; about 3 nights before she died; she was feeling the 
and myself in the night to call her grandmother (who is also a Methodist)
that the Lord manifested himself) she called her grandmother and said to [unreadable]
take me in peace and no more. I must be my 
to tell also what God hath done for her. In the morning Mrs. Davies
went to see her, and found her in great pain, but happy in the enjoyment of faith, she said 
about half an hour before she died, she had a hard struggle with the enemy. She 
said "I have just escaped hell; Satan would have me in best the Lord delivered me 
and whose I escaped another soul after. She calmly breathed her last. 
Her soul soon after the comfort of life was about just like a certainty. I have no 
doubt but she reached the blissful shore. Another old member of the society died 
lately, who was about 100 years of age. I went to see him a short time before he died,
told us, in a very satisfactory manner, that he had communion with the Father by the 
spirit, and an interest in the Saviour's blood. Glory be to God, our labours have not 
been in vain in this distant land. And we feel
