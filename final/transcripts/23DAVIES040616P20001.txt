We have had some increase to in the last quarter, in
renewing the Tickets I have in general found that they
had gone a remove towards the kingdom of heaven the
Number this last quarter is 129, since I have been here
about 11. have found peace with God. and 4 have left 

the Church militant to join the brethren the other side Jordon
Since I have lost my Dearest partner, I have spent many a 
gloomy hour, by day and by night, but hitherto the 
Lord hath not given me up neither hath he forsaken me 
to his name be glory for ever. I have inclosed you a copy 

of my Monthly return to his Excellency the Gov. of My schools 
I spend as much time as I consistently can every day in 
the school and find that the children are getting on 
gradually I have visited at different times some places
in the neighbourhood, but I can not do much in the 

Country without a horse; especially as I am alone 
and having so much to do in the Town if the 
place was not so extensive and the Society so small 
I would earnestly beg for a Colleague. I could have 
plenty of work for 7 a day. If I could have Consist- 

ently left this place, I would have gone lately to 
try the Country as far as Tomboo. The Capital 
of the Foolah King. if you recollect there were 2 
Missionaries appointed by Conferance for that 
country in the year 98. but I suffer that they

were never sent; I have seen some Foolahs in the  
Colony lately, They are tall and well built, in general 
All, as far as I could perceive Mahomedants. I have
seen some of their Arabic grogories. They think much 

of having the Temple in Mecca and the prophets 
Name on their books. They believe, that that will preserve
them from many dangers. I have sent an Arabic Bible
to the King. I asked them if they should like for 

me to come more to teach them Gods book in English 
they said they would be glad, and would mention 
my name to the King. I should be glad if I 
could get a few Arabic Bibles out, as I have 

other opportunities, to send them to different 
parts of Africa; and have but one left. I long 
with all my heart that the time may come, when 
Ethiopia will stretch forth her hand and Ham's 

children will be given to Christ. I have 
nothing particular to add at present please to 
present my respects to the Committee, I received 
your letter and saw Dr. Stonemouth. I have 

not been in Chapel yet. My kind respects to 
Mr. Wood & yourself. I am Sir yours affy 
J Davies.
