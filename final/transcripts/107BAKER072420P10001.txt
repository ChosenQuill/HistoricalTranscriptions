Revd & dear Father

This goes by Mr. S. L. 
Mr. Cauthy, who is returning to England on 
some family business, but returns here 

as soon as that is settled. He sent for me 
this morning on some business he wished 
me to do, & I then asked him if I might 
have the honour to introduce him to you 

by note. He immediately answered he should 
be happy of the opportunity of seeing you 
& observed, he would send on my letter to 
you & accompany it with his address, where 

you might have an opportunity of seeing 
him. That he assures that you will I 
have no doubt agree with me, when I 
assure you. A Governor more kind and 

indulgent than he his, I think no Missionary 
has, and I do most firmly believe he would 
do anything in his power to forward the interest 
of missions. As he behaved to Mr. Davies I know 

so he has been the same to me, & to all any 
who conducted themselves orderly 
In addition to our free & quiet enjoyment of 
every Religious privilege, he has on many occa 

sions shew me an honour of which I feel myself 
unworthy, no later than Thursday last, he at a 
Public Dinner returned me thanks for what he 

called my past exertions in the promoting the being 
Africans by Christianity 
at his H. Stronmake Joseph West Africa
