That he cannot pay that attention to the schools which is desirable  
and the Management of the schools principally devolves upon  
the Senior of the Boys or Girls.  

In each of the villages occupied as above there is no  
entrance for us  

Mr. Gannon the Chaplain is an high Churchman  
and Methodism will not (I think) have any assistance  
from him and while we render honour to whom  
it is due we must have a particular regard to  
the wellbeing of our own society.  

As the unpleasantness between Mr. Davies and the society  
has been mentioned; but I understand no statement  
given. I am urged by Capt. Rowe to state it.  
A woman who was a member of our society but from  
Creditables evidence a base woman; Charged Mr. Davies  

with having slept with her; This coming to the knowledge  
of the Leaders & Trustees they wrote him "Desiring he  
must not enter the pulpit till he had cleared  
his Character from the aspersions cast upon  

it" and they would meet at his house with  
the woman to have the business cleared.  
They meet and that evening they suspended  
their judgment they say but one of the  

Mr. D got an instrument by which they  
Parties were taken before the Chief Justice  
and Mayor who exonerated Mr. D from  
the Charge. The Leaders lay no stress  

upon the report of the woman but  
urge Mr. Davies warmth of temper  
as the reason why they cannot trust  
themselves to his superintendency  

he not hold his useful and persevering  
in his work but immediately engaged  

with Government with a design of  
doing what good he could in the county  
where he is at present till he has  
Instructions from the Committee  

As a consequence of the above the  
Chapel which Mr. Davies had obtained  
Subscriptions to build in Bree Avon is  
become an tottering or doubtful business  

an hundred and twenty pounds of the  
Subscriptions had been collected. but some  
withdrew their subscriptions and others  
begin to demand their money back  

Mr. D returned Â£20 - and 100 still remaining  
for which we had continual applied  
the stewards thought it might be  
well to return the whole but I thought  

otherwise and 2 things lead me to  
the conclusion we came to. 1st Our  
absolute need of a Chapel & 2nd to  
return the money would have shut  

the door of hope. We are therefore  
spending the money as far as it  
will go in the thing for which it was  
given - and when we have expended  

it we must have recourse to  
weekly subscriptions warm.  

As to my own experiences. I feel anxious  

for the full image of Christ impressed  
on my soul & to be useful. In great  
hast - Our Kind Regards to M Entwistle
