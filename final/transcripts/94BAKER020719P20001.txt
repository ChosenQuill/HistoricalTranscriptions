Tho I have not to boast of hundreds added to
Society, yet we have had many added I
trust such as shall be eternally saved. But I can
rejoice most in the growth of the People in grace
of which I have many evident Proofs, and very
many of them are the joy of my heart. I am far
from repenting my journey to Africa & I trust
ever shall. I love Methodist discipline as well

as doctrine and I endeavour on all occasions to
enforce it and I do believe the Lord hath blessed
this to many. It is really amazing to see how many
are stirred up to diligence who afore time were
loiterers in the way & an hindrance to others.
Among those lately brought in are several Backsliders
some of whom are not only come back but have
found Peace with God. The latter end of the last,

The beginning of this year, was marked by a gracious
outpouring of the Spirit of God & several then step-

there been time we commenced quarter after 9 &

a Woman named Sarah Dale said. Massa
before time I walk in a broad Road. But Christ

he call me. A this time I walk in a way for
Saviour Christ be mine. My Brether my Sister
that he be true she no be lie, suppose die
come to night I no be â€˜fraid for die.

A Man who has been a notorious sinner, gang
so far as twice to attempt suicide, said,
What thing me can do for God me no sauce tank
him, boy Christ, I live in e bank, but Chris he

come he give poor African light. He come in
my heart, I feel em. I trust Jesus, I think
he save save me to Heaven. An then a
poor penitent said, Which way I can find God?
Me hear plenty People talk, beg save God, me
beg on hand for save me, me no feel any ting
but me beg em, Lord Jesus what me can do
come live in my heart.
