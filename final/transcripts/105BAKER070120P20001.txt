preferred to Dr. Richardson's Arabic Grammar and an Arabic  
Lexicon. If there are any published Arabic & English  
I have Willmett's but I hope there may be better  
than his. I am certain from a knowledge of this People  

we shall need every argument we can bring forward  
to face them; and it is only when looking that the promises  
of God's Word I have any hope of their conversion  
It is amazing how thickly these People are spread over

Africa in endeavouring to convert the People to their faith  
And tho the want of Christian instruction they too  
generally prevaile. At Port Loo which is at the head  
of this Sierra Leone River the People are all Limmanee.  
Limmanees, but here the Mahomedans have obtained  
leave to open a school for their Children-to teach the  
Koran. There is a Gentleman here in Town who  
owns a great deal of land in that Place & is  
indeed looked up to in every thing by these People  
& tells me he has often endeavoured to shew them  
the impropriety of this, but they always silence him  
by observing they would be very glad to have their Children  
taught God's Word & to have White Minister then but none  
will come to them. I therefore that their Children may  
not remain not remain in ignorance like themselves  
they suffer this. I have promised the Gentleman to go  
with him as soon as the Rains commence to look at the  
place. He has offered to give land to build an house  
on & to then build the house himself & also to give a  
present toward the support of the Missionary if  
the Society would send one. Their language is easily  
attained & they are a very quiet People spread over a  
large tract of their great Country. I hope my dear  
Father will take this into consideration  
There is again to leeward of us a Cluster of Islands  
about 90 Miles distant called the Plantains the  
Propriety of one Man named Bomber L considerable  
portions of the Main Land is also his. This man  
received his education in England where he resided  
6 years. He has lately begun a translation of the  
Scriptures into the Sherbro, & I understand from  
those who read it, is very near our version  
He has also translated some of ours & some of Dr  
Watts Hymns, & Keeps Morning & Evening Prayer  
in his Town. And he has also by his Example  
& persuasion prevailed on the People of the Coast for  
a distance of from 30 to 40 Miles to observe the  
Sabbath day. These are certainly great things &  
an amplefieldf precious Oumers. Here Sherbro People  
are pure Heathens and are our next Neighbours

hounded as the Limmanees are upwards. This Mr.  
Eanker does not (that I know of) engage the Minister  
but calling his People to Prayer & most earnestly  
wishes for Missionaries. How surely my dear Father  

if ever there was a Call here is one, I have stated  
bare facts & the things, themselves are in every one's  
Mouth. In reference to Health if there few directions  
I sent are attended to in the choice of Missionaries  

& they will be careful & prudent at first, there is not  
so much danger as many represent. I could this  
Moment place 6 Missionaries among pure Pagans  
where there would not exist a doubt under the divine  

Blessing of their being gloriously useful, and all  
of them within the distance of 120 Miles, & this  
Place would be just in the Center. I hope my dear  
Father will allow me to say this is not the Efferves  

cence of zeal, but the language is certainly springing  
from the Mature & deliberate observation & observa-  
tion of notorious Facts. I have been long enough  
in Africa to form some correct notion of the nature  

and I do not hesitate to say with respect  
Part of this Country as few obstacles to their  
evil as in any part of the World, and when a  

the Soul every where is of infinite value. May  
all the force of its feelings & Powers cry., how  
us more labourers. do you my dear Father in  

In Mercy to these poor perishing Heathen for Christ  
send more help here. shall we let the Disciples of this  
vile Impostor ride on triumphantly, & we tamely submit to it  

or shall we more effectually come up to the help of the  
Lord against this mighty. Our Work have blessed be God  

state per one but of this you shall hear by the next  
opportunity. I must now conclude as the Vessel sails in  
few hours. I hope I am not forgotten in your Prayers  
I remain yours affectionately &  
Respectfully    

P.S. Mr Nichols will hand you my accounts  
you will see what I say on the Boys account I  
have not added that but wish your leave to draw  
I shall send a Bill by this for Â£ 50 according to Rule  

another for that sum must go by the next which you  
will please honour  
Our House is now comfortable, I beg defiance to the  
heavy Rains. That will it mark any Repairs need a  
few Shingles now & then for the next 30 or 40 years
