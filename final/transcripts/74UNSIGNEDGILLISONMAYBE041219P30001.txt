and the piece. I shall pray that God may give him favour 
in your sight, that we may from you receive some help. 
We shall have a trustees meeting next Monday and then 
I shall write and state every thing to you, and if it does not 

appear that there is a new Chapel wanted here as much as 
any part of the world then we may freely give it up clamouring for 
you. The inhabitants of this Colony are composed or made up 
of persons from nearly all the Nations of this vast continent. 
There are some here from Timbuctoo & those on the Niger 

and we generally observe that they settle in groups of the 
same nation in different places keeping as distinct as 
circumstances will admit. And it is our intention God 
willing that we live till next dry season to endeavour to bring 

the Gospel among some of these peoples are composed of the most 
abandoned characters, but these too shall fall before the all 
conquering Word of Jesus' Grace. We have consulted about our 
Board, and intend to raise 35s pr week, we shall make a trial 

of this, if it will do we shall be glad, but our expense 
will be increased by our keeping 2 Stations, which compels 
us to have 2 Tables and consequently 2 distinct provisions & on 
2 boys out of the 7. things are very dear and not likely 

to be cheaper in consequence of the great influx of inhabitants 
not only from Slave Ships, but from the different Old 
Regiments, which are sent here to be disbanded. 
The Chapel at Cago Town is brought to Roofing. 

I expect it will take 90 or 100 to finish it. I have 
also had to purchase a few things to put in the hut after 
we arrive when there and where our Boy who is assistant school 
Master also resides. April 17 the last night received by a 

young man passenger in the Lacey, the Magazines and 
Reports, together with a few lines from Mr Taylor. And 
could our dear Father tell what joy it gives us to hear from 
them they would often send us a letter. To receive a letter from 

them shows you that we are not neglected or forgotten and many 
may not be aware how this operates upon us in this Country 
where even while in what is here termed health the intense 
heat is so calculated to make the spirit droop and affect 

the nervous system that we often need stimulus to call our 
faint languid hearts into exercise. Hence to us to hear from you 
gives such edge to our zeal, live said that our friends at home 
pray for us, we hear how the work of God is going on elsewhere 

and we receive such exhortations as pushes us forward in our 
duties and we begin as it were afresh in our Work. We suppose 
if an endeavours gives satisfaction at home, if so the joy 
we feel, exceeds for the joy a Minister at home could feel 

in reference to his sphere of labour. If we do not in our 
endeavours meet the expectations of the friends at home we 
desire such advice as is best calculated to lead us into the 
right way.
