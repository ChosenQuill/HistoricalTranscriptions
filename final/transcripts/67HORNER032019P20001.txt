One of the most abominable festivals ever celebrated
is just now ended: it is the annual festival of the Holey, and
always lasts 4 or 5 days. A part of the ceremonies is the worship
of fire, which was performed on the night of the 11th inst. large

holes having been dug by the road side, in which fires were
made. A plain English description of the general charac-
ter of the festival cannot be given. The following sentences
which I have thrown together in easy Latin will give a
faint shade of this black and abominable scene:

Senes juvenes atque pueri,—omnium aetatum omnes,
et Brahmanes et qui in infimis habentur, vestitu rubro et
flavo colore maculatis amicti, turba promiscuè ingredi-
untur. Hi colores (sic enim audio) menstruas atque

virese semen designant! In feminas quae forte apud eas
occurrunt, aquam pigmento rubro commixtam, per syrin-
gam injectam infundunt. Nocte, multorum agmine facto
spurcidicos versus cantantes, permultasque voces obscenas, in

quibus praecipuè membri (scilicet generationis) virilis et
liberis nomina ore rotundo eduntes, per vias publicas e-
cedunt! Per quinque dies et noctes, omnia sive dicta sive
facta, ad stuprum et flagitia habent incitamenta!

- Et haec est pars istius exsecrabilis Hindorum superstitionis quae, ut aiunt quidem, viam ad Deum et caelestia
demonstrat!!

I have both in Sanscrit and Mahratta a short ex-
tion of this festival from its institution; but were it to be
read, I am persuaded you would throw it into the fire. 

The Jeminia which left England 20th August, ar-
rived here 10th instant. She brought nothing for us. The Revd.
Mr. Clow, minister of the Scotch Church here, is come out in
her. I was in hopes of seeing another missionary.

Sir Evan Nepean is about returning to Europe
when Mr. Elphinstone will succeed him in the Government: 
I have heard that Mr. E. is not as liberal in his views respecting 
missionaries as Sir Evan. May I suggest to you whether it wo.
not be politic for you to present him (to be delivered by me)

a copy of some standard work from the Conference Press, as a 
kind of introduction,—for in India you can never go 
into the presence of a great man, British or Native, empty-handed.
