2nd. Sir

As I have wrote two letters 

to the Committee & have received none in 
answer. I feel a lack perhaps (which has 
remained till this late opportunity) to write 
again: and at the same time am not easy 
to see to let this opportunity slip.

Our Society appears to be a little more 
united as the evils in part (which have arisen 
from various causes) are removed. I begin to 
have hope concerning this matter that it may 
be in the end for the good of all concerned.

All our members being persons who are advanced 
towards the meridian of life or beyond it. I have 
felt particularly anxious for the spiritual welfare 
of young people and have opened a meeting 

every Tuesday evening for them, when I 
endeavor to impress on their minds the first 
principles of the doctrine of Christ.

I have also opened two schools one at Portuguese 
Town which consist of between 20 & 30 scholars 
principally adults who appear very wishful 
to learn. To these people we regularly preach two 
or three appear to have some conviction which 
has improved their conduct. (God grant it may 

end in their salvation.) These we have put under 
the care of an experienced christian. They ingeniousl 
appear to be plain wishful to be taught and to 
have their children brought up in the fear of God and 
as they term it “in White man fashion”.
