respectable Gentlemen usually attend chapel on Sunday  
evenings. Had we a good Chapel, our religion in the town  
would prosper, but till that is the case the narrow limits  
of our Congregation are fixed by those of the present meeting  
house: which is exactly represented by one of your crowded  
boxes in England.  

Ten thousand thanks to our kind Secretaries and  
Committee for the sympathy and love which they commu-  
nicate both by word & deed.  

Your Missionary intended spending another year  
in Africa which was the desire of the Society & the Secretary  
but the conversations of the Committee with the young  
Brethren on the subject of the expense and also other  
weighty reasons have led him to conclude on taking  
the following course which he is fully persuaded the Com-  
mittee will see as the path which divine providence points  
out for him to walk in. He has made it the subject of prayer  

and deliberate consideration declining to act from his own  
mere will or judgement. Your Missionary has no  
intention of taking himself out of the hands of the Com-  
mittee no! he is placed to those fostering hands by the  

bond of affection which will not easily be broken, and  
where ever you in your wisdom may appoint him  
he will go. Your Missionary has affection for the work  
of the Committee and the fullest confidence in the Com-  

mittees' wisdom, goodness and puts himself without  
reserve in its absolute power.  
The Committee's directions fully to introduce Messrs  
Baker & Gilison is what your Missionary will gladly  

prayerfully attend to, and it will give him the  
highest pleasure to transfer unimpaired every particle  
of cordial affection he may have with the dear and  
inhabitants before he removes from the Colony.  

Our very dear friend Captain Brown without any  
solicitation has freely offer'd to give me a passage
