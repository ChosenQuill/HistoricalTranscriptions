Extract of a letter from Mr. Brown  
Missionary, dated P.  
Sierra Leone  
Feb 4, 19. 1819  

Rev. E. dear Brother  

It is with feelings of  
gratitude and pleasure I sit down to  
address you. We arrived at this place  

and came to an anchor about 7 o'clock in the  
morning at 9 Mr. Bacon accompanied by Captain  
came on board to see us and after breakfast we  
went on shore and proceeded to Chapel together  

Mr. Brown pressed upon me much to preach which  
I felt unwilling to do, as I was so unfit from having  
been deprived of regular sleep, thro the intense heat  
for 2 or 3 nights before we landed. But notwithstanding  

declining this, I felt my soul much blessed, and I do  
believe the people were blessed also. On Monday  
we waited on his Excellency the Governor, who received  
us very politely, welcomed us to the Colony and wished  

us success in our Mission, and a continuation of health.  
such what I have been able to see I think &  
thrive for the welfare of this Colony. We have been with  
Mr. Brown to Portuguese and soldier town where he  
has had to preach, and truly my soul was blessed—  

then did I see more simple sincerity than in many of  
these new people; It appears that the Lord has very lately  
been reviving his work among them, and many have  
found peace with God, and simple as they are in the  

manner of expressing their feelings, yet it is very evident  
they enjoy the peace of God. On Tuesday evening we went  
to Portuguese town, and just as we arrived the Book  
(Head Man) had just sent his boy round with a small  

Bell to summon the people to meet, this the turn  
they are in calling them together. We met one of the members  
who had lately found peace with God; and questioning him  
on the subject he said O yes massa me feel good in my  

heart, me look up me see Christ, Me look down, Me  
see Christ, Me look in a bush me see Chief, Me see him all  
every where. Passing on we called at a hut where we found  
a poor woman quite in transports; She had lived with her  

last night to the town—a/c engaged in prayer found peace  
and her language now is "Glory be to king Jesus, Me  
want to go to him me love (meaning that moment)  
indeed her very eyes sparkled with joy." We walked  

meeting house, (of which Mr. Brown will give you a narra-  
tion when he arrives home) was filled with his divine  
presence the prayers of the people evidently proceeded  
from their hearts
