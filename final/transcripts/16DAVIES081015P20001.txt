glorious work we must be coworkers: for "How can they hear without a Preacher, and
how can they preach unless they are sent?" I have it in contemplation, when the
dry season sets in, to visit the country, the towns and villages in the neighbourhood

of the town. Carrying on a mission in this place is expensive, as all things are
exceedingly dear; and the society but small, tho faithful, if it [unreadable] not for the great
expence, I would have certainly petitioned the Committee for Another preacher; then

from his Excellency the Governor, Col. Macarthy. When we first went to Freetown,
there was no one to superintend the Colonial school. I offered my service for a time, which 

was accepted, [unreadable] and when his Excellency got[ unreadable] Sutherland to engage in the School, he

His Excellency could get a fit person. [unreadable] named of it, and the next day on 
going home from dinner from His Excellency, I saw the following printed notice posted up:

We have been anxiously looking out for furniture to 
lay upon since we came here, but the mattresses we had 
from home we have been obliged to lay out a deal of money.
