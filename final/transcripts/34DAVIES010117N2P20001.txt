since his Excellency the Govr the Council and most of the reputable
part of the People in the Colony had a publick examination of the
School under my care, and were astonished to find some girls
who knew but little 13 months before able to spell words of 5
syllables without a book, his Excellency observed on his publixk
thanks in a long speech, and the Commissary General, in the Bench
whom I had before solicited for a Subscription for the new Chapel
and who refused to give anything, said he would be very glad
to become a subscriber to my Chapel for the sake of the good 
I had done.— I wrote a short letter to [unreadable] applying for
a removal as I do not like to destroy my constitution under present
circumstances, I should be glad to go to the West Indies, may 
now back or come home from Limbrick. Lord open away by 
thy good providence for thy unworthy worm. [unreadable] speaking
with Captn. Rowe, & hope the Committee will consent when all things
are considered.— I am now trying to instruct the recaptured
Negroes in a Town about 7 miles from Free Town, I have about
170 in this Town and 330 in two other Towns close by, but as I have
been but a short time amongst them I cannot say I have as yet
seen any good done [unreadable] but I leave all in the hands of God
by endeavouring to do my duty in sowing the seed twice a day
and four times on Sundays, I have a small salary from Governmt.
till I receive orders from the Committee how to act.
most of the Subscribers towards the erection of a new Chapel
have applied for their money back, and am afraid I must return it.
There was at the time I left a prospect of much good among the
young people, but was in the Chapel last Sunday to introduce [unreadable]
and was sorry to see the Congregation so small and very dead, since
I came here my I have laboured but full of sorrow and am most
afraid that trouble would shorten my days, but thank God my
spirits are better now than I expected.

My Dear Friends,

Since I wrote the other letter, thank God I have
seen some fruit in this wilderness 3 or 4 appears to be under
a deep concern about their Souls Salvation, the people of the
Town attend the meetings but not many of them understand
English enough yet, one young lad who came out from the Borough
School and who was very wild was sent by his Excellency to assist
me, is under deep conviction for sin and wrestling with God day
and night.— The Govr is causing a building of Stone to be erected
90 feet long by 30, two stories high, part for a Warehouse, part for a

nine Stores, part for a House of correction. and an upper story 
for a School Room and a Meeting House which I shall 
be glad to see finished, as my House is too small to contein 
the people, I have a Sunday School and shall have a Day 
School as soon as possible and if the Committee think best 
I am willing to remain, as their Minister in Leopold’s town 
and Mr Brown in Rice Town, my salary will keep me 
from any expences both Committees and if the Lord will 
make me useful am willing to sacrifice all for his 
Glorious Cause. 

I am afraid Mr. Brown is rather embittered against 
me by the influence of the leaders in Rice Town as he askt 
me a question that grieved me much the last time I saw 
him; viz. “are you a friend to the Mission” the question 

I know was put by the leaders owing to the European 
Subscriptions, which I cannot help and hope they will 
not. Though the Governor wrote to me, and told me 
the last time I saw him that if I would not attend 
the meeting at Free Town he was determined to withdre 
his hand. I am sorry I have no better news to inform 
you of,— There is a large field for usefulness in 
the Towns in the Country and I have my health and 

as well as ever I had in Europe if not better, I am 
very willing to remain if the Committee judges best or 
come home, or go any where as they direct it is my 
unmaterial to me where I end my days, only let my 

life be hid with Christ in God.— On Sunday Evg. I preached 
in Regent Town, Mr. Johnson a Schoolmaster from that band 
missionary has been very useful there there are near 40 already 
wh I asked one of the men the day after I preached there. “well 

how is your heart to day? O said he, my heart as tis heretofor 
other your heart live now? upon top, meaning heaven,” I wish 
to be useful & hope to see better days. God Almighty bless 

you all dear dear friends, I am indeed happy at this moment 
and the God of Daniel afford you every comfort, but ever 
obliged friend T.D.
