Free Town March 4th
18/9

Revd and Dear sir

Your parcel which
you sent by the Schooner Nancy
came safe to hand on the 28th of Mar.
I cannot but feel gratefull to our
worthy committee for the extreme
kindness which they show to
Those Missionaries who labour in
This station & for one who is less
than the least
But I hope that their attention
will not be in vain but that
they will be amply rewarded by
the prosperity of This Mission
Western Africa has been low on
the Missionary lists for a long time
But the cause has laboured under
many disadvantages for some time there
has been but one Missionary here
and he has been unable by sickness
to attend to his appointments
But Glory be to God the work has
been for some time and still continues
to increase it is not uncommon
to hear souls crying out for mercy
and believers are straining for all the
mind of Christ our chapel is far to
small there are many people who
come and go out again because they 
cannot find room but another house
is coming home beneath still their things
