was a sad misunderstanding between the Doctor & the   
Committee 2 The Committee seemed to be altogether ignorant   
of our circumstances, the circumstances of the place, &ci  
&ci of school 3 they did not tell us what to do with the   
property purchased by Mr. Warren & they did not promise   
to pay our passage home 5 having forsaken our little  
all we had not therewith to pay for it ourselves.   
On the whole we think we have not been dealt with   
in the most Christian like manner. Most of the above   
were also the reasons why, as Mr. Reynar must have in-  
formed you, we accepted one of the Salaries from Govern-  
ment appointed for their School, and joined themselves   
together. The Teacher of the Government School was   
now our assistant—one of us was regularly with him, &   
being at a small expense over it the school was consid-  
ered as our own; i.e. the Methodists. But, on account of   
the above assistant's being turned out of his place &   
the care of the school, therefore resting wholly upon us—  
as the Doctor wished us not to draw upon the Missionary Com-  
if possible, & the one Salary was insufficient to support the  
sch, we applied to the Governor for the other Salary paid   
by the assistant, and got it, and, as now we are at no expense   
in the school, we think it will be entitled to another   
denomination, that of "Government School." It is yet   
taught in our Chapel as usual. The management &c   
of it is left to our discretion— and we trust it is on a fair   
way for prospering than ever. As it is wholly at   
the Governments expense, we think it should not be   
mentioned by the Missionary Committee in their next   
ing reports as the "Methodists school". Tho' we are both   
engaged at school & have the Salaries for it from Govern-  
we continue to do nearly as usual for the Society, without   
being at any expense to it or to any body else or whatever.   
The present state thereof is nearly the same as last quar-   
tion. Two have gone to their reward one others Wilkin-  
son The old lame & blind Teacher mentioned by Mr.   
Black in his journal as having been very useful in   
Snow Sketch was exchanged this week by another or   
 &c or more have been added so that our number is   
yet one hundred & seven. We have also kept   
our arrangement with the Doctor concerning intervals   
their agreement in account of the school as received

from His hand towards our support; and that such  
remains as are necessary as we have in reserve for the  
help of that Messenger of God whom we trust we shall  
shortly have the pleasure of seeing. The last quarter was  
the first for which we received 2 Salaries. Their amount is £6-10-9 per  
quarter. We have received from the Steward of the Meeting  
in the New East Lundyers 12-7-1½ and we have also listed  
belonging to Mrs. Warren 22-0-0. The whole of what we have  
on hand is £41. We are in hopes that if our Salaries are  
continued to us, this; with what the Society will contribute, will be little, if anything, short of supplying both  
us and the Preacher. There has been nothing drawn  
upon the Missionary Society, nor upon Dr. Coke  
since that of 250 dated Dec. 2, 1812.  

We have now only to request that you will take upon  
you the trouble of sending us a few articles, which  
we have frequently requested before of the Doctor for  
this purpose. We wish for    
2 nd. of Pencils. We want them to sell to the boys, there  
being none in the Colony. A key to Joyce’s Tutor's guide.  
The 9th and following No’s. of Mr. Wesley's works. The Methodist  
Magazines since April 1812 that being last we  
got. The Methodist Mag. since March 1812. We want  
also for one of our members, a watchholder that is simple  
& as Military Schoolmate - Mr. Wesley’s Life of His Father  
do. David Brainerd’s, do. Henry, do. Mr. Walsh, do. John Wesley  
Hervey’s Meditations & Moses devout Exercises - Young’s Night  
Thoughts - and Dr Coke's Commentary on the Old Testament.   
We have just sold this man the Do. New Testament belonging to Mrs.  
Warren. Please send the prices including the package &  
both of the foreLafter mentioned articles  

for the Mission Board of House. 2 of Pork. 2 Firkins Butter 2 cask Sugar

thing we are very much in want of, as we cannot procure it  
in this place. And it will be greatly advantageous to Mr. Major  
to send all the above mentioned. There might be sent without  
fear of any loss in them provided they be well packed.  
Praying that every blessing may attend you, we are  
Dear   Sir
