we have great reason to lament; yet we must not dispair, 
things will prosper. O Emmanuel, why doth the wheels of thy 
glorious work move backwards; for "how can they hear without a Preacher, and 
how can they preach unless they are sent"? I have it in contemplation, when the 
dry season Set in, to visit the country, the towns and villages in the neighbourhood 
of Freetown. Carrying on a Mission in this place is expensive, as all things are 
excessively dear; and the Society but Small. The faithful...if it was not for the great 
exertions! would have certainly petitioned the Committee for Another preacher; 
with whom were we so verviced, one could be in the Town, and the other could visit the neighbourhood. This I must leave at 
present, hoping to see better days, in every respect. We meet with every encouragement 
from his Excellency the Governor, Col. Macarthy. When we first went to Hogbrooke, 
there was no one to superintend the Colonial School; I offered my services for a time, which 
was accepted, and when his Excellency got Mr. Sutherland to engage in the School, he 
wrote to me, as follows: "Sir, his Excellency, the Governor, begs to return you his 
sincerest thanks for the very handsome manner in which you came forward to perform 
the duty of Schoolmaster of this Colony. His Excellency feels highly sensible of your services on 
the occasion, and requests me to inform you that he has accepted of your resignation. 
Mr. Sutherland, who is appointed to succeed you, who will enter upon the situation to-morrow. 
I am, Sir, your Humble Servant, J. Willford Esq." When Mr Grant, who had a salary of 
100£ (was going to resign the girls' school, and as there was no person capable of superintending 
it, I sent word to his Excellency, that Mrs Davis could take the School for a time, 
not for the sake of any emolument, but for the sake of doing good; she would take it until 
his Excellency could get a fit person for the situation. He was much pleased with it, and the next day in 
going home from dinner from his Excellency, I saw the following printed Notice at her door, 
Notice. Mrs Grant expressed a wish to resign the situation of schoolmistress, which is hereby given 
that the Children who now attend her school will in future be instructed by Mrs. Davis, who has 
voluntarily & gratuitously offered to superintend their education, until some other arrangements 
take place. Such persons whose Children under their care, are of an age to receive 
instruction, are requested to send them to Mrs. Davis, at such hours she may point out. By command 
of Capt. Willford, Esq." But as Mrs G. has not as yet resigned, the affair is not quite settled. 
There is a number in the Colony, more to be pitied, as the laws, and the neighbourhood. 
I am sorry to find that it is Europeans in general that enter the town, and consequently 
bear a burden against the Gospel when they are but tender plants. I am obliged to 
you for the Reports and the Magazines, as I assure you they give much pleasure in 
this distant land. Should be very glad to have the Welsh. but perhaps at a future period 
you may have an opportunity of sending them. The Church Missionary Society are going to 
make a large Settlement on a Hill called Leicester Mountain, about four miles from 
this place; which, in my opinion, is a good plan for this country. They will strengthen 
the Christian cause immensely under this plan. Missionary work demands...
