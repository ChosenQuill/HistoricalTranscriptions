requested, Both and Myself,  
I would likewise observe that with present circumstances, were  
as much as just, and unite us more closely to each other. They  
also call upon us, affectionately, to sympathize with our Dear Bro'  
and [Unreadable] Robert, and earnestly to recommend them to our common  
Lord. Their situation is indeed peculiar! Mrs. Roberts has been  
  
very unwell ever since we left the British Shores. When we  
left anchor, tho' the weather was remarkably fine, and the sea  
unusually calm, such was her weakness, that she could not bear  
the motion of the vessel caused her to faint away.  
  
And as our [Unreadable] here was likely to be [Unreadable], it was thought best  
not to attempt to get her on shore. But when the storm came  
on, we were all alarmed, and knew not what to do for the best.  
However the vessel yesterday morning continued to pitch, and roll  
in such a manner, that the Doctor gave it as his opinion  
  
that the attempt was absolutely necessary. I, and one other  
[Unreadable] vehicle were prepared, meanwhile Mr. Roberts, and the Doctor  
at the hazard of their lives went to seek a suitable lodging  
somewhere; they learned, they had taken an apartment at a  
  
house, and for Mr. Roberts' [Unreadable], were to pay a Dollar, nor is half  
a Crown. This seemed the only remedy. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Buchanan's  
daughter were ill just at the [Unreadable] Mr. Roback and the steward  
Roback in her [Unreadable] whilst the [Unreadable] took charge of the other  
  
[Unreadable] gladly would we have shared their danger, if we could have done  
so without increasing it. But the Captain advised us not to accompany  
them. We could only stand on the Deck, and with fearful anxiety look  
from our mooring towards the shore, and our hearts almost fled until, as  
  
[Unreadable] look failed, [Unreadable] by the waves, I [Unreadable] of rain came on, which  
[Unreadable] as so from seeing them land. But we learned afterward that  
by this means relief was effected. Poor Mrs. Roberts was too far  
sensible of the danger. However when she got on shore she  
considerably better. We remained in the ship, and such a  
  
[Unreadable] have not seen before. A vessel lies at anchor near us, and  
our Captain feared that her cable would break, and that she would  
run into us. However this morning no accident has befallen us,  
having as yet heard nothing of Mrs. Roberts, but are quietly  
[Unreadable] ourselves to the raging waves, in order to get some [Unreadable]  
  
Monday morning March 15th   
In rather awkward circumstances, and in a gloomy state of mind I thus tried to  
express my feelings on Thursday morning; and as it is probable  
same [Unreadable] to [Unreadable] I think I may turn backward  
  
When we got on shore we enquired for Mrs. Roberts  
[Unreadable] were directed to the place, and were glad to find Mrs. Roberts  
far better than she had apparently [Unreadable] strength,  
Mr. Roberts is about uniting to Mr. Bunting, you will know better  
  
more on this subject than I can give you. We had no idea  
[Unreadable] be so long, nor would this have been the case if the weather  
[Unreadable] but for several days the sea was in such a state it was  
impossible to get any of the cargo on shore

And from this you will be able to form some idea of our situation.  
The motion of the vessel was so extremely unpleasant on the succeeding  
evening that we could not sleep, and hence it seemed absolutely necessary  
that we as well as the rest of the passengers, should spend a little time  
  
on shore. With being so long on the ship, our spirits were low  
and our strength exhausted, and considering that we had a long voyage before  
us we thought ourselves justifiable in leaving the ship until Saturday  
evening. This of course has been attended with some expense, but if  
  
we call at no other place till we arrive at beyond, we hope the money we  
have will almost be sufficient for us. However, be that as it will  
imprudent I am we have not been extravagant, and if you know any of  
our fathers, and brethren, in the meantime know all the particulars of our  
  
conduct we are certain they would meet your approbation. Our situation  
now is by no means enviable. While the rest of the passengers are enjoying  
themselves on shore, we are frequently rocking about in the cabin alone. The  
Doctor, and others, sometimes wonder at this, but the fact is, we wish to  
  
spend as little as possible. In reference to preaching on the Island we  
feel much disappointed. We thought it most advisable to wait on the English  
General Mr. Roberts called upon him. He was very condescending  
and obliging, but at the same time gave it as his opinion we had better not  
make the attempt. He very properly observed, that the Protestant cause  
  
was only in the infancy. We informed no that the church which they are  
now erecting, had been carried on thus far with much opposition, and  
that if we made the attempt, it might so arouse the minds of the  
Priests as to produce greater opposition, and that in this case we should  
  
ultimately hinder the cause we intended to promote. And indeed  
as this is the season of Lent, we should have found it very difficult to  
collect a congregation. They had yesterday a very grand Procession. Bro'  
Both, and I went to see it, and such a scene we never witnessed  
before. The town was quite thronged, and the streets crowded with people  
Every thing had the appearance of a Feast or Fair. The shops were shut, and  
  
scores of People were carrying Baskets about filled with sweet meats, and  
other articles they had for sale. In almost every street there was some painting  
representing Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Apostles, or our Lord, and when the inhabitants  
passed these painting 'pones they pulled off their hats, and very reverently bowed  
  
After we had walked about a while, we very fortunately met with the Captain  
the Doctor, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles, at Mr. Gray's; the view exactly opposite  
the conversation was, the procession we made, and from the windows of this  
house we had a full view of the whole concern. About 150 soldiers with their  
bayonets fixed on their guns, were drawn up before the Convent door, and these  
  
were accompanied by perhaps half as many with Drums, and other instruments  
of music. Some kind of service was going on in the Convent which was crowded  
to excess perhaps it contained 2 or 3000 people. At length the service  
within was concluded, and a man dressed in black having his head covered  
  
with a black veil blew his trumpet to certify that the procession was  
about to move. He was followed by more than 20 individuals, and striking  
objects in sackcloth, covered with a veil, and each carrying a cup. After  
them there came a poor wretch, whose arms have been so numerous, and  
  
appearance, that to make an amendment by there she  
walked. He was followed by another, pitiable indeed  
and had his arms extended, and tied by a rough piece of iron running 'bouf 5 or 7 inches. Then the Priests appeared tipped in black and each carrying  
a lighted torch. And after them was the image of the Redeamer.
