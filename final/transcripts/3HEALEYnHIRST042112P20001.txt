here he was heavily afflicted, he then sought the Lord & 
found him. But soon after his recovery he went up the River 
a trading, where he lost his relish of heavenly things. Last 
rainy season he was again brought to Death's door by the same 
Fever; and in his distress he again cried to the Lord, who, he 
said heard & delivered his soul. But he was again raised in 
body, yet, after all the Lord had done for him, in a little time 
he was, apparently, as far from righteousness as ever. There 
is no stability in him. As it respects any support we can 
get in this place, we find it abundantly more easy to 
give it. The Society has not given us any thing, but a few 
necessities now & then since we came. Mr. Warren, when alive, had 
a small matter of them. Last Ladyday [March], there was about 
£5 in the stewards hands, which had not been expent in 
the Chapel, and in his hands it remains. But, Sir,
however dark things may now appear, we feel no doubt, 
but that if a plain, bold & lively Preacher should come out, 
he would, through the blessing of heaven, change the 
face of them—he would be useful to the Souls of many. Then 
to besides attending to the day school, he should have an 
opportunity to go without the walls and visit the poor 
Natives, in their own habitations. Oh what a prospect 
is here before us, that an extensive field for faithful 
labourers. There are many hundreds of Natives round about 
that know a little of our language, and are entirely ignorant 
of God & deep in Sin; yet are we barred from them by our 
labourers in the city, for want of such a preacher as above described. 

We have upwards of ninetly boys on our List for the School, 
Eighty of whom are general attendants. About twenty of 
them can read on the new Testament, and ten of these are 
learning arithmetic, some of them are in division. If are more
what promising. We begin in the morning with reading a 
chapter & prayer—go out & come in at noon with singing 
in hymns, in general, from Senious Collection, & break up at 
night with singing & Prayer. Besides teaching them the arti- 
whole letter, we endeavor, as we are able, to instill in their 
minds, the spirituial meaning thereof—by argument, and we 
think we may add by example, we enforce upon them strict 
morality whether in or out of School, at home or abroad. Our la- 
bours in this way, we have reason to believe, has not been 
altogether in vain, since we have both seen the effects.

of its purchase & heard of them from the Mouths of others. 
We have not a teacher in the Chapel, which is but incon- 
venient on account of the meanness of the Desks we are 
able to fix there (the poverty of our people forbidding us— 
& other) the dullness of the room, & our distance from it. 

The people have no intention to pay anything for the 
instruction of their boys—some of them have hardly a smock 
to cover their nakedness, when they come to School. How then can we 
expect to take anything of them? It is likely (as Brother Mac- 
-near must have informed you) that we shall lease one of the set- 
laries allowed by the African Institution. 

We have not yet made up our Quarter—We believe the expen- 
ses have been very little. They will now encrease. Our Flour, 
Sugar, & Treacle is done. We have part of a barrel of pork 
left and a little butter but then likeen, nothing worth. A barrel of 
Tongues & most of the Peas are left. The following articles sent 
it yearly would greatly ease the Mission 1/2 Barrel of Flour, one 
and one of Beef, 2 Firkins of Butter, a couple of cheese, a barrel 
Sugar & a few lumps, one barrel of Molasses, a quantity of 
Spices, Mustard, Pepper & such little things as you me- 
more necessary. These should all be well made up or they will 
be spoiled. We want a few Table & tea-spoons, cups, saucers & glass 
tumblers, something for Tablecloths, towels &. Everything here is very high. 
We particularly want some slates & pencils for the School. It is 
likely that we take more of Mahogany & Wine, Rice, Provisions 
round a dozen, Ale is 7 5. Wine is in general £3 a dos. A Quarter Cask 
is from nineteen to twenty pounds. Would be easier to buy it by the Quarter. 
Would it not be easier to send Ale & Porter from home? P. Hirst has 
mentioned Dr. Clark's Bible several times, but it has not been sent, 
he has the 3 first parts & wants the following, he intends to lay down 
the money for them as he takes the draft. We should thank you 
for the continuance of Wesley's works & the Magazines. We have got 
8 Volumes of Mr. Wesley's. We have the April No for 1812 in the month 
of Magazines. We believe we had the same for the same year in the 
Methodist magazine, but having lent the April No to a friend, his 
house was burnt up & that along with it. We also particularly 
for want of Keys's Key to his Tutor's Guide the 4th Editn. We have 
sent you enclosed a copy of a Grant we have obliged to get for the 
Lot of Land on which the House stands. We lost 5 Dollars—gold 
the instrument & 12 Dollars for registering. Dear Sir the letter we received from 
you was the February last dated Whaley Septr 17th 1812. In that you were to send 
a note once a month. Never then we have had several kinds printed and in 
reply to a letter. Pray do write more frequently & will your...us the 
N.B. Sir last remember relatively that Christ...
