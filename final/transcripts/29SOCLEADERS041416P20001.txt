All these we consider as necessary to support credit-
tably and according to his station one missionary; we

allotted for your missionary, have annually £100 worth of 
cloaths which when it gets here is equal to about £300 to

Methodist missionaries however stigmatised, have generally 
better success. Even here there are several natives who 

among us have been brought into the glorious liberty 
of the children of God. They have been baptised not only 
with water but with the Holy Ghost and a with fire sent 
down from heaven! May the Lord add many more such 

to our little flock. — Mr. Davies’ work enlarges on his hands.

see him taken off as much as possible from all earthly care, 

that he may attend with more composure wherever a door 
is opened unto him, and may have the more time for read- 
ing, meditation, and prayer. There are at present in 
society one hundred and twenty nine, a small number
