Monday 22d March. Several days ago I called at the Government
House, wishing to have an interview with the Governor; but the Secretary
not being at home, I sent him a note requesting to be informed when I
might be permitted to wait upon Him. Accordingly yesterday morning being
at the Fort Church, an Aid-de-Camp came to my seat and requested me to
be at the Govr. House after Divine Service. I went immediately, and was very
handsomely and obligingly received. I stated in few words that having
heard of His Excellency's intentions of leaving India, I thought it a duty im-
cumbent on me to wait on Him, and in the name of the other Missionaries
in India with whom I am connected, as well as in my own name to present

our most grateful acknowledgments for the favourable notice which His Excel-
lency had pleased to take of our Mission, at its commencement; and for the
protection I had since enjoyed under His administration—
and at the same time to express my regret at the prospect of being de-
prived of His Excellency's immediate countenance and protection. —
His Excellency was pleased to answer, in the following very handsome manner; "That it was
his opinion that we deserved to be countenanced and protected; he highly approved
of our proceedings, and was pleased at noticing the prudent line of conduct we

had pursued; by which none of those unpleasant feelings had been excited which
were anticipated; and he was happy to assure me that he had not heard a sin-
gle charge of impropriety alledged against our Mission, since its commen-
cement; he felt a very high regard for the Missionaries in Ceylon who first land-

ed, and most cordially wished us all success in our undertakings."
His Excellency that my Brethren in the Indian
Empire would consider themselves both honoured and obliged by so very
favourable an expression of His Excellency's sentiments; and that we should con-

sider ourselves in duty bound to remember his attentions with gratitude.
After a few cursory remarks on either side, I withdrew, His Excellency ac-
companying me to the door, and shaking hands with me in quite a friendly
manner.

On this subject I shall offer no remarks: You will form your
own opinion.

Not having any thing particular to add, I here conclude,
requesting your continued intercessions at a throne of grace in my behalf,

Respected Fathers and Brethren,

Yours in the Gospel of Christ,
