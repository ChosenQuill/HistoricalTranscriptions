to learn to read. The school was continued but for a short time 
sickness and death caused a suspension
and finally a dissolution. After continuing my 
ministry under many discouraging circumstances 
we had at length the pleasure of seeing some 

visible fruits of our labors. A man and his wife 
became experimentally acquainted with the saviour 
The work spread and four other members professed to 
experience the same blessing. The society at this 
time consists of fifteen members and some on trial. 

The sincerity and evangelical nature of their conversion 
was very clear from the agreement of 
it with that of Christians 
in all ages and countries. To hear unlettered heathen 
who have not been in the habit of associating with 

Christians speak scripturally and feelingly of the 
good grace in the renewal of their 
souls, as an evidence of the truth of our holy religion. 
One man in 
a conversation with child-like simplicity said 

"This time I have four eyes two with which to see 
the things of this world and two with which to 
see the necessity of my soul and the great truths 
of religion" On asking another if Jesus was precious 

he exclaimed with feeling "Oh precious Jesus. Help him, 
every time, I can see Jesus. If I look up or down, or in the 
bush, I see my Jesus." Another 
One man in a conversation with 
the brethren observed that before I visited them in the 

village they were blind and that he and the people 
had received great good from me "I wished to turn 
his views to the true source of every good and 
perfect gift and said it was not I that had 
done them good, he immediately answered and 
truly, and explained himself thus "you are

are the tool and God has used you to build 
an house for himself" On my remarking in a 
conversation with some of them that though they 
gave a penny a week towards the support of 

the gospel, and payed for the oil with which 
their meeting house was lighted they were on much 
better circumstances than when they knew nothing 
about Jesus Christ one answered for all and said 

"Oh yes God makes our money to grow, if a man has 
four dollars God will soon make it eight" The above 
general detail in connection with the 
following Tables being founded on fact and 

void of embellishments may assist in 
forming a moderate judgment as to many 
particulars relative to the Sierra Leone 
Mission.
