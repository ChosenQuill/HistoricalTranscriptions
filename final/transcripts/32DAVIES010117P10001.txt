Resd Fathers and Brethren   
Mr. McGowan arrived safe in the Colony on the 27th December. I am sorry to inform you of a disagreement between me and the leaders in Free Town. I have waited a fortnight in trying to make it up, but to no purpose, and Mr. Brown has been determi- ning the same. They have made up their minds not to have me as their Superintendent any longer. I am now in a Town about 7 miles from Free Town endeavouring to instruct the natives. I have about 170 recaptured negroes in this town and two other towns in the neighbourhood in all about 500. but as I have been but a short time among them I cant say much respecting any good been done. The people are willing to hear. I shall receive a small stipend from government till I receive your orders, it appears highly necessary to apply for a removal. As I have but little prospect of being useful in the Chapel in Free Town; neither do I like to be receiving my salary from government. I shd. be glad to go to the West Indies or home or any other part of the world; it is immaterial for me where I labour. I wish to live and die a methodist Preacher. If Capt. Howe will go by the way of the West Indies, I think that I can have a passage gratis by him, and if I dont receive your directions before, I think when all things are considered, that you will judge with me, that it is necessary for one to remove. I have inclosed the last 2 quarters accounts. This mission is an expensive trying one, but I hope God will revive his work. I have been in deep waters the last twelve months. Wishing an interest in your prayers. I am Respected fathers & brethren

Your Servant in the Gospel

P.S. As it is likely the leaders will state what they have against it is unnecessary for me to say any thing in my defence at present.
