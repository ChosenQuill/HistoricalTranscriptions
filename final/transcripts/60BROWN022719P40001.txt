with him to England, and my friends in the  
colony will I hope give me something to eat while  
on the Bottom of the Ocean. These things having  
occurred unsought for, have lead me to conclude of  

coming with him. And when I shall arrive if the  
committee conclude on sending me out again, the expence  
will be about the same as if I went from Africa.  
The above are some of the reasons which have lead  

to the conclusion, but not all, others will be evident  
to the committee. I cannot deny but that it will gratify  
me very much to stand before you, and see them  
& the wonderful works of God in my native land.  

I also am desirous of attempting to direct off the  
attention of some whose hearts overflow with christian benevolence  
to the objects of Missionary labours in Western Africa.  

I am greatly obliged by the grant of fifty pound  
from Annam for the instruction of recaptured children. We  
have nearly finished the walls of a stone chapel  
30 by 20 in Congo Town, in which we shall be able to  

teach the children to read, the adults to pray. There  
is no other place of worship near, and I calculate  
that there are about 50 or 60 Children, & 300 or 400 adults  
within a mile of the place. We have sent in a petition  

to His Excellency the council, to grant us the land  
on which it stands & an allotment sufficient for a  
hut in which the school-master Mokes Brown, my  
Boy, (whom I have taught to read & write) may live in  

He is an apprentice, a recaptured negro & with fears Joh.
We scarce know how we must pay for the building  
but now the first fifty pound will help us out of  
our difficulty as fortunately our schoolmaster will cost  

us no more than his usual food & raiment & of little  
pocket money. You must know our kind Ju.
