Revd & dear Father,

As my first of a

Bill for Â£120 ps. by the way of
the West Indies & expecting it may
yet come before the vessel from
here to England arrives, I send by

the same Vessel this Letter paiwise
according to your instructions on this
head. As I am now by myself and
know not how soon you may give

me room to remove from hence,
I should not have drawn so large
a Bill but that I must more
money for new shingling the House

& some few necessary repairs to
make it tight, to prevent a worse
inundation than I had to experience
last Rains, which would another year
