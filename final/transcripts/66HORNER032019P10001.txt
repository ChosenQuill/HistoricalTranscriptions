No. 11. Horner to the Missionary Committee
Tronbay, 25 March 1817

Respected Fathers & Brethren, 
    Having been very unwell se-
veral days with a bilious attack which has left me very weak
and low, I hope you will see a sufficient reason for this letter 
not being as long as it otherwise might be made. I wrote to you 
15 February last, and sent by the Ship Traveller for London, which 
sailed 7th inst. An intimation was made therein of a packet of 
sundry articles intended to be forwarded to you; which I have 
this day delivered to the care of Mr. West, a gentleman return-
ing to England who has kindly offerd to be the bearer of it. I 
shall be much obliged by your permitting the two parcels con-
tained to be sent according to the directions, filling up the 
last edition of my letters; as I do not know in what course 
he may be stationed. 

    I have opened a fourth school; the 
complement of boys is now 180; a few have left off coming 
since the schools books do not contain any portions of the 
religious and other writings, but the general number 
is on the increase. One great evil, and in my opinion 
greatest is the frequent recurrence of holidays; these are 
neither not merely days of play, but in general seasons 
set apart for particular forms and ceremonies; yet though 
styled holy days, they are nothing but times of mirth 
and revelry. When leave of absence is requested by my 
schoolmasters or boys for such purposes, I invariably refruse 
giving at the same time my reasons for so doing. With-
out or without permission, the scholars absent themselves at 
particular festival; - but still some effectual remedy must 
be devised; it appears a high evil to have one's authority so 
overlooked by their acting directly opposite to orders, than to 
give the slightest apparent encouragement to their idle expenditure 
of application of time by granting leave of absence in 
such circumstances.
