Extracts of letters recd from Mr. Davies
at Sierra Leone Africa, dated 16 May 1879

My ever much esteemed friend Mr. W. H. Kennedy

I have to acknowledge the rec of your
kind affectionate letters by Mr. Kennedy, who arrived here
in safety with his wife on the 27 Dec. I thank God will
pray you abundantly for your kindness & attention toannoy
me. I have waded through deep waters these last 12

months, many troubles and few comforts have enjoyed
All my consolation is that God is not a stranger to my
soul. The leaders of the Society in Free Town have tried
against me and threw me on the pulpit. I am too
plain for them, and truly I have found them a

proud stiff necked generation. I understand they are
going to accuse me of lording it over them, of being
proud for a Methodist Preacher, and of paying
so much attention to Government, the truth in this respect

when we arrived here we found Methodism very low
indeed, in the esteem of Government and the European
Gentlemen in the colony. My dear departed Sandt and
my own conduct some how or other pleased the

most respectable part of the community, in consequence
of that some got jealous, most of our Leaders as far as I
can judge are of the American Republic spirits and
are strongly averse to Government, I am a loyal

subject to my King & wish to do the little I can
for the support of Her Government especially as in a foreign
plantation there are not so many able advocates as at hone
- before God I can say I never sought for honour

in this place. I tried to do as much good as I could.
I am now the senior aldermen in Free Town and a
justice of the peace. I objected as much as I could to hold

without absolutely giving offense to the Governor, which it
was not my duty to do; for His Excellency has been and
continues to be as a father to me, and I feel it my duty
to obey him as far as I can consistent with Christian duty.
