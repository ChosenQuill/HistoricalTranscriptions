A Missionary but had much to discourage  
him; labouring principally among a people who are so  
naturally indolent that without being constantly watched  
and excited they are liable to instability; and I now  
feel particularly on this head. My Colleague dead, myself  
sick, and the weather so rainy, that our friends and we  
always visit the country places even on Sunday. This  
makes me tremble lest the crafty enemy should take this  
opportunity of sowing discord; and all I can do for them  
is to beseech God in their behalf, and write this there  
are other things. But on the other hand I am as happy  
at times almost as any soul can wish, I would not  
thus give up my dear People for an Emperor's Crown.  
I trust my dear Fathers you will take my situation  
into consideration, and send me help which may be  
here by January next, & by no means to exceed February  
as I expect the Rains will be early next year from their  
being so late [unreadable] but there is no doubt that they  
will be more favorable. In reference to this help  
I can assure you I am certain nothing can go well  
be done here effectually with only 2 Missionaries. My  
Reasons are, First, this station is not I am persuaded,  
any other we have. A man cannot do here what  
can do in the East Indies. The Church Missionaries  
here, have each their separate station. This Country  
not passed by misstress for itinerating from 12 to 14  
in Emphamphnent to be the Itinerants. [unreadable] time to  
grade a Hills & Valleys & half in almost momentary  
expectation of Rain, which if It falls would without  
quite produce fever; and if we stay at [unreadable]  
[unreadable] people are disappointed. Again, if one falls  
sick the Work is sure to lose the other [unreadable].  
How 3 Missionaries might be placed usefully and  
have plenty of Work. 2 might stay in [unreadable] they  
would have 4 places and not as much work as they  
could possibly do. He then might be placed at some  
Town: either nothing great can be [unreadable] tell this  
is the Case as they are so far from us. He might  
keep School & the Bay of poor [unreadable] be removed  
to [unreadable] Town where he is much wanted  
and find two or three houses of houses, where  
he might occasionally teach. But one could readily  
change once in 3 or 6 months with those in [unreadable]  
& then if one should be taken sick, two could take  
forward that part of the work which should be  
judged of most consequence. I trust my dear Father  
will not think I am dictating what they shall do [unreadable],  
I only submit it for your consideration. I can assure  
you it is not only my opinion, but that of others.

who are well acquainted with the subject and with whom  
I have consulted. The general way here with the Missiona  
ries in this Mountains is to call their People together  
at day break every Morning, and I think it is 8 o'Clock  
evening, for reading and Prayer, this is merely the best  

means for, it keeps them from wandering, but this we can  
not do without more help. You will no doubt feel  
the loss of my Colleague, but your loss is small when  
compared to that of the Church Missionary society who  

have already lost 3 besides the Chaplains of the Colony  
who died since my last to you and I think Mr.  
Lenna the present Chaplain told me they had lost 20 Missiona  
ries this station since its establishment. I am happy to say  

the greatest harmony exists between myself & the Church  
Missionaries. In reference to persons who may be ap  
pointed for this station I would beg leave to observe  
I great care must be taken in reference to their  

Habit & Body, Persons of a certain habit will by no means  
do for this Climate. My poor departed Colleague suffered  
much from this insomuch that a few days before he was  
taken sick he was taking some kind of Medicine or other  

every day. The Surgeon tells me that he is certain he  
got worse since his coming to this coast, & so will any  
the Person of that habit. This is also a bad thing in  
as that lives remotely of itself, so that nothing  

do for the slightest Fever, Glysers, Persons coming  
must be free from inward complaints a broken  
constitution will not get better here. Persons of a  
Phlegmatic habit are not fit for this Climate  

Cheerful even fearless persons best sent here, in these  
respects my Colleague was admirably suitable.  
Persons who have been used to Het and Cold will  
be better fitted to stand the extreme damp  

of these Rains than any who have been used to the  
warmth of a Room all their Lives, if they could  
be lean yet strong they would suit better than a  
full Habit.â€”In reference to the clothing some  

alterations would be much for the better, some good  
strong shoes, the bottoms made as tight as possible  
a Pair of short Boots laced at the top under the  
Pantaloons, with very thick strong tight Soles. I have  

been obliged to buy a Pair here & I know not what  
I could do without them, tho they are but thin in the  
bottoms. I could be glad if I had a pair of shoes  
big enough to mean outsize another pair, nothing is  

better in this country than them. It would be desire  
well also for all shirts to be Cotton, the Linen ones in  
the dry Season are like ice when wet, which makes  
us change often and this is weakening. Some Woolen  
Stockings are indispensably necessary here
