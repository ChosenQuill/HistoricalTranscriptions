Rev'd and dear Fathers

You will see this annex I have received by the narrow way mine to you of August 20th and have no doubt read with concern its contents. For my part, I have been sick almost ever since. If I have been able to walk one week, the ague has most generally laid me up two or three. My last touch has been a month, during which I have had to contend with the quotidian ague and fever, which quite drank up my little remaining strength and made me almost as helpless as a child. I suppose were I now to enter your number Race, it would be no small matter of difficulty to you to find out who I was, but I am now gaining a little strength. Last Sabbath was my first day of labour, and here the Lord was better to me than my fears, for I had anticipated that my weakness would allow me to preach but once, but the Lord assisted me also in the evening and when I thought the next day would find me again laid up. I was thankful to find no material difference between Saturday and Monday. But still, I am so weak I cannot visit one of my country places & I have no horse. I had one horse died & thought I would try to go without a horse and did make the attempt, but one week left was laid up, and the friends think it a hard attempt to do the work without one, but now there are none to be had. I can assure my dear Fathers notwithstanding those trying dispensations of Providence I feel happy in my work and am satisfied I am in my providential place. The Lord makes me happy by the continual manifestations of his favour, and many of these dear people make me happy by their unblamable life and conversation. Glory be to God, unworthy am I of such an honour, yet he is pleased to make me useful. Here in Town I have joy, time since I had to cut off some who lived were consistent and who I believe been a stumbling block to others.
