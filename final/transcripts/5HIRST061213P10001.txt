I must for bean, one for candle one half hundred weight of sugar, two
firkins of butter, one barrel of molasses, two cheeses, some e-
ssence of spruce, mustard, pepper, nutmegs, such of them requiring 
as you think proper. A few bottles tea spoons, cups & saucers, table
cloths & towels and some slate pencils for the school. A box of
soap, this was not mentioned before, some glass tumblers. Then
we requested you to send half yearly. We are at present in want 
of them. We also told you what raisins &c there and that we
should have more wine & small liquor for the support of
our constitutions, and that it would be much easier for the
mission to have the ale and porter from England, more account
of their great expences here ale being 25 pr doz. Porter 26 pr doz.
both frequently more. Wine we get here as cheap as in England.
