now a few months residence in England would restore 
tone to my Constitution & I should then come back to this 
country restored to Health, without being by any means 
so liable to [unreadable] as before. I might then be fit for any-

such fatigue as visiting the Coast should you wish it. 
I wish to be allowed to Marry & because I am fully persuad-
-ded it would be to the Glory of God, my mind has for some 
time past, been urging me to solicit your leave but I have 

omitted it as I thought it would look so much like a want of 
change; but since I have made up my mind to ask you leave 
the comfort I have felt is great 
I am here exposed to many temptations and as my dear 

friend Mr [unreadable] the Topoes are a furnace, so I have 
found them, & I find temptations at times most grievously 
heavy I have maturely weighed the matter & most fervently 

asked God for Direction: and I am persuaded it is my duty 
to ask your leave to Marry. If I had a wife (a fit one I 
mean) to such an one I pray God to direct me, she might 
be of incalculable benefit to my dear Rescattined People 

& would I am sure find the [unreadable] of them useful 
& [unreadable] enjoyments, a full reward. There is an idea I 
believe prevailing at home that Females do not live here as well 
as Men, but this is without proof: and if Females coming 

here are of good sound Constitution & will be careful the first 
year, it is the opinion of Medical Men that they stand 
not in so much danger as ourselves 
There is a difficulty in the shortness of time for the settlement 

of such a thing because as I told my dear Father, when I 
offered myself I was free from engagement; so that there 
is now both choice & competition to take place 

But should you consent to my request, doubtless some of my 

dear Fathers, would be able to point out a fit Person to 
megor at present I have no one that I even know of that 
would suit me and the Station, as both [unreadable] here to be 
[unreadable]: Piety, Health, Cheerfulness (necessary here to health) 

A Missionary Spirit & some degree of what is termed Education
the nearer these mark the better for my own satisfaction as I 
do think an ignorant woman disgraces a Man 
There are qualifications of the greatest importance, but as 

perhaps when home I might not meet with a suitable Person 
willing to come to this Climate: I must unreservedly promise 
to return to my Station, should this be the Case (tho I think it is 
3rd not likely 

I should have an opportunity of saying many things to you which 
I cannot write, & should I trust be able to afford you more 
information; you may not yet have received, I am assumed to the 
[unreadable], Mission & Neighbourhoods.

I know that you will (very naturally too) look at the expense 
If it were in my Power I would gladly bear it but this 
is not in my Power, yet there is this to be considered 
My Passage home would not cost more than to the East Indies 
therefore it would only be the Passage again 
again, & I then should come with much less risk than a fresh 
Person, By the time I could reach England, say 2 years would 
be nearly expired & thus I should not intrude much on any Plan 
a thing I wish always scrupulously to avoid

However after all I have said I leave myself in your 
hands, & at last I should feel resigned were you to think 
proper not to accede to my request 
I yesterday dined with Capt Grant the Commandant of 

the Gambia [unreadable] who is now our Governor & with whom 
it will be recollected Angelo & Bickellson came to 
this Coast. He feels quite gratified at the idea of serving 
in the Gambia & expresses himself ready to render us any 

assistance in his Power I enquired how we should be 
situated in reference to an House, & he told me we should 
procure a lot of Land & must build a stone bottom to it 
house & must have a frame of wood on the Top 

He will be returning there just as we are ready to go 
I shall be happy to take us with him, when I hope 
to get our Passage free. I have now to ask of my 
dear Fathers as early an answer as they conveniently 

send 
I remain yours respectfully & affectionately 

[signature] 

P.S. Bro Newby will be able to give you informa 
-tion of the work as I have with him, we now number 
260, & I believe we have turned out 
not less than 39 Persons who were a disgrace to us in 
any place where discipline is at all attended to 

Recapitulation 

Perhaps my letter in the part referring to my return here 
may be thought founded, but all I mean is, that I am willing 
to remain here as long as health will admit. For tho I might not have any means, yet all standards are subject to Cholera 
[unreadable] or Ague, the latter of which is almost always the 
cause of continued Ague, of which I have had two repeated attacks, & I fear 
am constitutionally inclined to it. In either of the latter cases 

remaining here would be madness. I wish to say something too 
about the Missionaries of this Coast removing to Areas in case of sickness; 
in order to recover their health, whilst I do not come home, I will 
act with you at large on
