Many of them would begin and say a few words  
and their full hearts would then prevent them  
and bursting into tears they would exclaim. My Dearie  
my Jesus me no cause that what my heart feels  

Our more serious Attended persons friends sensible  
ness of the truth of Religion, One Man was brought  
into liberty and was reclaiming. I can now believe  
I feel the Love of God. I immediately after him rose  

His Wife and bore testimony to the same truth. This  
caused a shout of joy to arise that the whole. Many  
bore testimony to their growing in grace, & many I  
do believe received a deeper baptism of the Holy  

Spirit, and many who are seeking had their minds  
considerably strengthened. Our watch night the next  
evening and the Covenant on that Sunday were  
marked by the divine presence & was a sensible  

blessing to many. And thank God this work  
goes gradually on. Sinners more or less coming and  
saying we will go with you for we have God is with  
you. Some weeks one or two then 3 or 4 but Saturday  

night I think it was 8 or 9 admitted on trial and  
I assure you we do not even admit them on  
trial till we have many reason to think they are  
earnestly seeking good. Congo Layon is reduced  

from 25 to 16, and I could wish they had not been  
so indiscriminately admitted here, and yet our  
numbers are more than but recent uncertain  
Several of our Members have died within the  

last 6 Months and among the rest a Mrs. Cum  
mins who had been a. Backslider from God   
and was when we came here singing on a hopeless  
frame. But one evening while James preacheth  

some theatre of the things is oft heard.   
She was sensibly and powerfully awakened she  
struggled hard for liberty and it was I think the  
very evening before our Lovefeast, while Bro. Gillson  

was preaching, her soul was set at liberty, but it  
was not so powerful but she resisted it and could not  
believe, but the next evening at the Love feast she  
was fully delivered & enabled to rejoice. Tuesday week  

before Christmas before her She Ticketed & joined her  
well & happy in God. The day following Christmas  
day while surrounded by her friends, she crossed away  
to Heaven her times of other Backslides, she began to  

consider if they did not embrace the moment it might be  
like the last call. She while it encourages a report now  
will I know rejoice your hearts yours respectfully Baker.
