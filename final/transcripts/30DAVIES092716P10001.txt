Extract Letters from Mr. W. Davies to Mr. James Buckley  
Free Town, 29th September 1816.

My Dear Sir,

Last night I received your kind letter of June 13,  
with the Magazines, &c, but I have not received those you  
mentioned that were sent in May — but your letters of later  
dates have received. I feel exceedingly thankful for your  
kindness in sending this information, they are truly  
interesting in a Foreign land; and although I cannot  
send you much information respecting the enlargement of  
God's Kingdom in Africa; I greatly rejoice that others can from different parts of the word. You desired me in  
your letter to be particular in my opinion respecting the  
utility of sending Coloured or Black schoolmasters & Mistresses from the West Indies; I do not see the necessity of sending Schoolmasters, &c. Send as many 
preachers and wives as you can; for those that have  
given themselves wholly to the work appear to me to  
be the most suitable pioneers in the cause of Christ for  
it is an easy matter for the Methodist preachers'  
wives to become teachers or superintendents of Schools in a Foreign land; but not an easy matter for a schoolmaster to be a respectable Minister, especially in Sierra Leone.  
Certainly, as far as I can see, there is a necessity for  
a second Preacher; and an auxiliary Minister  
likewise to do good here — [unreadable] in any opinion will not [unreadable].
