Copy of letter to Rev. Jno Taylor. 11th November, 1818.

Revd and Dear Sir,

Your very kind and encouraging letter came to hand on the morning
of the 16th inst, and also the Publication for which I beg the Committee will accept
my warmest thanks. With mingled sentiments of gratitude and to the friends of Missions
and the blessed Jesus I sit down to give you some few particulars relative to this
Mission.

I have by the good hand of my God been brought through two sickly
rainy seasons, they have been fatal so to many who bid fair for long
life. It is truly cheering to the Christian Missionary to enjoy persuasion that he is
his friend who possesses ........ government and reigneth as King forever. Justice
being the habitation of his throne. This ........ ........ when brought to maturity
and put in full exercise, gives security and anchorage to the Society to weather out
the windy storms and tempests. But frequently and my grief the reproof of the ........
his unbelieving apostle has had too just an application, "Oh thou of little faith
wherefore didst thou doubt" Though my unbelieving fears have often thirst at.......
spiritual life, yet thanks be unto God, who giveth ....... victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.

The following is a general statement of our work, congregations,
christian endeavour, pastoral ****** care, state of the places, worship.
From the above and other statements I flatter myself the Committee
will see that the suitableness of sending the help, ........ promised by the first
opportunity; especially so when they ......... upon the having a congregation and Chapel
being now built by the Maroons at the West End of Free Town.

I hope the committee will also take comparison on ........ and assist
us to struggle out of our very miserable accomodation at the East End of the town. Surely
the younger children have a prior claim to the affections and assistance of the parents
than those advanced in years and strength. Greater ........ (I think) hath no people.
They (Their committee) have successfully fished ........ sites, is there eventually a
life probability of success in the vast ocean of waters? Does not the Lord declare
"Bishops shall stretch out her hand unto God" Another important argument is the
layer we may be in of losing many of our hearers when the Church is completed, the walls
are nearly raised to their intended height and then accomodation will be good and
abundant. I have not stated through mistake the number of places of worship in the
different places in which we preach, but it is easily done, there being more in Free Town,
the Church services are held in the Court House .... which exclusive of, our old Chapel
there are three others which belay to have Nova-Scotian people of colour. A runaway
Methodist ........ and a Secedeen are the preachers at each place.

I have been under the necessity of drawing upon ....... treasurer
for £50 since my last advice. My account ......... all is well) be sent by the next vessel.
I wrote to Mr. Benson requesting to have sent me a complete ....... commentary and a copy
of his N.T. Quarto bound .... when I was in London through purchasing an ....... and other
things I was short of money and the ........ promised lending me £10 which ................

I thought it safe and honourable to credit ....... as if I had
received it; if I can correct ....... are benevolent, disposed to rectify the business
by applying to money towards paying for the before mentioned book, I shall esteem it a
great favour. Because I am sensible of having received already the highest evidences of
kindness and regard which I hope will perpetuate my gratitude and inflame my love and
seal in your service. If I should be in error about this business you will please
kindly overlook it.

The Ship sails in a few hours and I must close my letter,
wishing every blessing may attend our kind Missionary friends and our dear Connexion.

I am Revd and Dear Sir,
Your most obliged servant in the Gospel,
Saml Brown.

Free Town, Sierra Leone,
November 11th. 1818.

Revd J. Taylor,
N.B. letters which may be sent to Capt. ........ will be forwarded by the
first vessel that sails; as his son is with Pugh and Readman, the general brokers for West Africa.
