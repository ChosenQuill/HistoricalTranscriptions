The Joulaks are as far as I can learn peace-  
-able but principally attached to Mahomet and  
indeed that rigidly. The Mandingoes are a very  
cheerful simple People, but much given to stealing  

such as far as I can learn from my own observa-  
-tions of them & inquiries made, of these are the  
People inhabiting the Banks of this River  
What I would beg leave to propose with all sub-  
-mission is the following  

That St. Mary’s should not be made the princi-  
-pal of attack, but that on this Island land  
should be procured an house erected & one Mission-  
-ary placed there, he himself might find  

plenty of employment in keeping School & preach-  
-ing & there would then be a place for the  
reception of those who might arrive before their  
departure for the interior & from this Missionary  

all intelligence might be forwarded to the different  
Stations. And here also a District Meeting might  
be held both for that River & also Sierra Leone  
the Chairman residing at either of the places  

you might think proper. But still I conceive  
the interior should be the point of attack and  
that entered upon as soon as any thing like a  
Settlement could be made at St. Mary's without  

which the Missionaries would labour under  
difficulties unknown in other Stations. The settle-  
ment which the Governor has made is I think  
called Sellebar and only 100 Miles up the River &  

also said to be healthy. Why I think St Mary's  
should not be the principal point of labour is  
that here on this small Island the population  
is indeed & must be limited. It hardly now contain-  

500 . The White People are such an hindrance  
to the Gospel, the Arabic language would be a  
most essential qualification for Persons intended  
for this River as a knowledge of this would instantly  

command respect from these People, and give  
him an opportunity to answer all their objections  
in a way he gives him no hope of doing by any  
other means. Could the first establishment of this be

attained in England it would be very desirable  
to make the attaining it here with fluency and   
very difficult. Why it would be harder to attain  
here is, that these People can scarcely any of them  

talk English any way correctly & therefore know  
not how to express themselves. I think however it  
might be attained if closely pursued in a few Months  
I should get up Morning & go into the open Air  

& speak aloud as their Boys do here who are  
learning which is certainly the best way as you  
then feel their manner of pronouncing &c.  
What I observed before of Persons being Married  

who go to these Stations I can assure you I  
feel still to be my decided opinion. I could  
therefore I feel willing to work here or  
any where else you think proper to send  

my only desire is to be in any place  
March 7th. By this Vessel will go a second  
of Exchange for £120 the first of which went  

a short time by the West Indies with a  
Letter of advice to you. I said then in this  
Letter I should not have drawn for so large  

a sum as £120 as I am now by myself &  
know not how soon I may be ordered away  
from here, but the house is not yet finished  

Roofing & as soon as that is completed I will  
send Home my full accounts as every Penny  

I draw, shall be satisfactorily accounted for to you.  
I know not when my help is coming but I hope  
not this side the Rainy Season as it would render  

their danger greater. Among other gloomy  

things in anticipation is that of having my house  
broken open & robbed. It has been twice attempted  
& the next house actually broke open & robbed to  

the amount of several Pounds. I have therefore  

been obliged to arm myself. This I trust never to  
have the necessity of using them which would  
mean be done but when my life is at stake  
but a knowledge of my being armed will soon  

spread & I trust deter them from the attempt.  
I think yet I am at present in good spirits &  
hope to be able to labour this Season without  
going to any anxieties.  

Yours respectfully &c.
