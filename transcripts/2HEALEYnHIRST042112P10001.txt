Rev. and Dear Sir,

As we expect you are anxious to hear
of the labours and welfare of your Missionaries we shall embrace
every opportunity for that purpose, as well as to make known
to you our wants, which we shall freely do.
Our labours are now entirely restricted to the town, having no
time to go among the surrounding tribes, though this is what
we came out for and what we are very anxious to do. The
Day-school takes up half of our time, one of us being there
every day, and the other half is spent in preparing Sermons,
some of which we write for ourselves, but chiefly to take those
of others, and attending to the affairs of the Society. The
order of our meetings is as follows. On the Sunday morning
at 5 O'Clock, a preaching again at 9 O'Clock, at 2 in the after-
noon is a prayer meeting, and at 6 in the Evening another
preaching. On Monday at 7 at night a Prayer meeting, at the
same time on Thursday & Friday are preachings. On the Thursday
evening at 9 the general band meets, on Saturday night we
meet the Leaders. These and Prayer meetings every morning
at 5 are all held in the Chapel. On the Wednesday night,
which before was vacant, we now hold a Prayer meeting at
our own house. The above are in general well attended &
would be very profitable had we better singing. The old
blind & lame man, Moses Wilkinson, is yet alive but attends
very seldom, and when he speaks, he outstretches his voice,
at times, to terror and frightfulness. Mr. Brown is
mostly sick & seldom able to do us service. Mr. Harry-
Whitten is a strong & healthy man but he is seldom willing
to labour. There are also two of the young Men, class Leaders,
Prince Sober & Joseph Lewis, who, frequently read us Sermons
in our service. The Sunday forenoon & night service we take
exclusively to ourselves, besides filling up the places of the
others in their absence. The numbers in Society are same
as Raymond's account, only a wanderer or two seems to be
returning. Also many of the people who had left the Colony
seem to be about to return, amongst whom are several of our
members. The young Man, a native, you spoke of, is yet among
us, but he is not able to write or read. He is a very quiet man
& a very well-disposed Christian. The other you spoke
